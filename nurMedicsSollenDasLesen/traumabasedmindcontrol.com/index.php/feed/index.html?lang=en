										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: right;" align="right"><strong><span lang="EN-US">„It is still not clear why the mother has weird sexual phantasies.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: right;" align="right"><strong><span lang="EN-US">MMag. Konrad Kubiczek, Viennese family judge in the Sadegh case </span></strong><strong><span lang="EN-US">concerning the horrific flashbacks of Luki Dara Sadegh, then 2 ½ years old, </span></strong><strong><span lang="EN-US">despite of having scientific literature on SRA mind control on his desk</span></strong></p>
<p>Satanic holidays have been mentioned in scientific literature on satanic ritual abuse or trauma based mind control [1] on one hand because of the confessions of victims, and on the other hand because of the registered crimes (abductions, rapes, mutilations of children) around these “festive” dates, meaning ritual abuse (physical, psychological and spiritual abuse).</p>
<p>Satanists are obsessed with rituals, symbols, numerology, and so these festive days overlap with the dates of all religions, which is one of the most important satanic/psychopathic characteristics, besides infiltration and silence, betrayal and deception. While holding solid, “respectable” jobs and attending their – official – churches, they celebrate their own “festive days” right afterwards.</p>

<p>The holidays, as well as the “language” of the respective calendars, is “old” and again underlines the centuries-old tradition of celebrating these festivals, together with bestial child sacrifices. The perpetrators, one remembers XAVAS and several other artists, do not usually dress up in devil’s horns, but are “in suit and robe” – that is, in highly respectable, bourgeois professions. These calendars also show how obsessed many Satanists appear to be with “sexuality”, preferably S / M – BDSM [2], as well as with body fluids (blood, semen, urine), as described in detail in the scientific literature on ritual abuse or artistically processed by artists such as Kim Noble, herself a trauma based mind control and ritual abuse victim. In his novel “eleven minutes”, the life-story of the Brazilian prostitute Maria, famous writer Paolo Coelho also outlines not only BDSM, but also reveals details of “holy prostitution / sacrifice”: power – powerlessness, sadomasochism (submission, subjugation), tormenting and killing “those unworthy of life”, especially “guilt-transference rituals”, as secret initiation rituals seem to be the main attraction for these groups. Due to the bestial crimes against children, in particular, one can imagine how many perpetrators want to break out of this vicious circle, as documented in the literature, but cannot, since they are caught on photos and video recordings and are therefore in the hands of the Satanists / psychopaths, and thus tend to conduct these festive days “in a spiritual manner” and try to seduce others to join.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Subsequently, one can observe the machismo of these networks, in which again only the proven stereotypes of femininity are allowed (witch-whore-saints), the feminine element is to be destroyed or suppressed, and also the obsession of Satanists / psychopaths with “interbreeding”, so that inter-generational “dynasties” are sometimes built in secret, in which women are used only as “breeders”, and due to potentially hidden cases of paternity, more people are in turn blackmailable. Due to the “changing of children” often mentioned in scientific literature, and reported by all former Illuminati and Illuminati-related persons – especially Fritz Springmeier, John Todd or Svali – intergenerational breeding can be better understood: bonds of flesh and blood are thus subordinated to the “satanic” goals. The experience of heartbreak, if it remains unreflected upon and unhealed, makes it easier to dehumanize others, and therefore to torture or torment also small children and babies. Again, this brings to mind the words of English specialists in this field: “No one wants to know that it’s happening next door”, because that means it isn’t a crime perpetrated “somewhere” upon “poor orphans” in a “distant continent” by “primitive natives”, but right in our immediate neighborhood in our western world. The bestial atrocities that people can carry out against other people, especially to children, simply take one’s breath away: American psychologist Colin A. Ross also states in his book “Satanic Ritual Abuse” that this ritual abuse is the most horrific thing that can happen to a child, as the damage is irreversible, and also explains why these atrocities must be concealed and denied at all costs: victims must be “disposed of”, as well as witnesses – “death to traitors” is the top priority of such groups. Psychologist Ellen Lacter describes on her website http://endritualabuse.org/about/overview-of-the-differences-between-satanism-and-witchcraft/ the different types of abuse conducted by satanists a well as witches (satanism vs. witchcraft): I have not yet been able to find any (specialist) literature on how, above all, these oaths, vows, pledges and promises of guilt can be resolved; this knowledge seems to have disappeared. In my opinion, this knowledge of how to revoke this ritual transfer of guilt, vows and oaths is “the holy grail” in the field of “ritual abuse”, since satanists / psychopaths are evidently able to change karmic / spiritual laws through rituals, i.e. to offload their own burden onto others. Interestingly enough, most of the people who deal with the topic, from the high-level Illuminati to the hobby esotericist, are convinced that one must have earned his / her “karma” by choosing it for themselves in this lifetime: these arguments can be found on Satanic NWO-pages (argued by high-ranking Illuminati), and is also propagated in esoteric circles as well as in teaching institutions for coaching, training and counselling, and subsequently I was told quite often – even by perpetrators in the Sadegh case – that the crime against my son and also myself was therefore justified. Besides offering the chance to comfortably blame someone else, this also enables another goal to be achieved – namely, to obtain the “moral” legitimacy to dehumanize the victims (even more). Nevertheless:No one has the right or permission to torture (small) children. No child in the world, no matter what their colour, their nationality or belief system, deserves this suffering. No child in the world should be allowed to be used sexually, spiritually, mentally or physically. Every single child must be protected from such crimes.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 24px;"><strong>TITLE:</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 24px;"><strong>2021 Trafficking in Persons Report, Austria</strong></span> |</p>
<p>Mag. Andrea Riegler:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.traumabasedmindcontrol.com">www.traumabasedmindcontrol.com</a> – (nongovernmental, non-government funded, private) network against torture on toddlers and children, dedicated to my beloved son Dara Rubens Sadegh</p>

<li><span style="font-size: 24px;"><strong>p. 17 Austria &amp; the Sadegh/Riegler Case</strong></span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 24px;"><strong>p. 18 Preamble or “the child has nothing”</strong></span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 24px;"><strong>p. 22 Excursus: Scientific Literature | MK ultra </strong></span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 24px;"><strong>p. 52 The case of Sadegh Dara Rubens &amp; Riegler Andrea in a nutshell</strong></span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 24px;"><strong>p. 62 Conclusions about the situation in Austria</strong></span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 24px;"><strong>p. 63 TIP 2021 Questionnaire</strong></span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 24px;"><strong>p. 137 About me.</strong></span></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 24px;"><strong>PREAMBLE </strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 24px;"><strong>“There is no initial suspicion in this case, therefore an investigation of the case as well of the alleged perpetrator(s) is declined”</strong></span> is the <span style="font-size: 24px;">most common – one-sentence &#8211; reaction protective parents receive</span> from <span style="font-size: 24px;"><strong>prosecution offices in Austria</strong></span> on extreme abuse, MK ultra and SRA related trafficking crimes. Therefore, no wonder, the government of Austria is still in TIP report TIER 1 also stressing, that <span style="font-size: 24px;">“<strong>The government identified relatively few child and labor trafficking victims and has not identified any Austrian trafficking victims in recent years.</strong>”</span> (out of TIP report 2020):</p>
<p>This would be bad enough, nonetheless, <span style="font-size: 24px;">the </span><strong><span style="font-size: 24px;">common practice is even worse: Thousands of protective parents of tortured toddlers and children</span> </strong>in Austria are<span style="font-size: 24px;"> thrown out of hospitals (prevented from the urgently needed medical care of the little ones), police stations, governmental child help centers</span>, <span style="font-size: 24px;"><strong>most often</strong> are hunted down by intelligence agencies and CPS (Child Welfare Department), <strong>separated from their beloved children</strong> in case they are not willing or able to keep silent</span> <strong>about the horrendous acts of torture the little ones had to endure</strong>, <strong>declared mentally ill</strong> and <span style="font-size: 24px;"><strong>destroyed systematically</strong> from any field of government and its sub-contractors. Many of the protective parents got <strong>suicided or</strong> <strong>killed themselves “willingly”</strong></span> in due course, <span style="font-size: 24px;">not able to bear the many forms of bestial <strong>“Zersetzung”</strong> </span>(i.e. erosion on a soul level<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>), <span style="font-size: 24px;"><strong>intimidation, threats, and open violence</strong> </span>(<strong>including – mass &#8211; rapes, burglaries, destruction of private property, manhunts, poisonings, electroshocks from outside the house, gang-stalking, cyber torture<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a> <span style="font-size: 24px;">or even forced to witness the suffering of their tortured children</span>, etc.</strong>)</p>
<p>The recipe is quite easy, as <span style="font-size: 24px;"><strong>where there is no investigation, there is no case, </strong>while <strong>fulfilling officially the international standards against child trafficking, as a so-called first world country:</strong></span></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 30px;"><strong>THE GENOCIDE AGAINST TODDLERS AND CHILDREN AND THEIR PROTECTIVE PARENTS IS NOT STATISTICALLY RECORDED IN AUSTRIA, THEREFORE NON-EXISTING FOR INTERNATIONAL TRIBUNALS AND COURTS.</strong></span></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 24px;"><strong>Those who are daring to collect cases systematically got murdered or suicided, especially to warn others, never ever to even think of reporting such crimes to anyone, therefore this report will focus on the generally available literature, newspaper articles, etc. and the own Sadegh/Riegler case. </strong></span>To speak out not generally but in detail for others, would make my beloved son an orphan, within a few days<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>.</p>

<p>Despite <span style="font-size: 24px;"><strong>several references in the scientific literature<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>, as well directly from (inter)national whistleblowers<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>, researchers<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a> and survivors<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a>, besides horrible cases<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a> pointing directly to SRA, MK ultra, pedo-porn, and trafficking-related crimes</strong></span> (Jack Unterweger, Josef Fritzl, Natascha Kampusch, Dara Rubens Sadegh/Andrea Riegler), the Austrian government and its judiciary, backed up by supranational intelligence agencies <span style="font-size: 24px;">is not only going on <strong>to murder or silence those who speak out</strong> about the horrible crimes against babies, toddlers, and children</span> on a daily basis <span style="font-size: 30px;"><strong>but now also start to MUTILATE publicly children </strong><strong>in foster care</strong> </span>(here my beloved son, Sadegh Dara Rubens, whose adult teeth were taken out completely not even 9 years old; this after his reproductive organs got destroyed, aged 2years old<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a>/<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a>), <span style="font-size: 24px;"><strong>in order to punish them for their protective parents, who speak out, as well to threaten and intimidate everyone who finds out about SRA and MK ultra networks in detail. </strong></span></p>
<p>Over the decades if not centuries, <span style="font-size: 24px;"><strong>compromising material from all disciplines is piling up in mile-long shelves about the trafficking situation in this country, the Austrian government and its judiciary still feels free to silence everyone</strong> </span>up to now, in the <span style="font-size: 24px;"><strong>“Alpenfestung”</strong></span> (alpine fortress) – a country that seems more to be an open MK ultra and trafficking hub than a country itself – <span style="font-size: 24px;"><strong>either by killing, hospitalizing, mutilating, or forcing survivors and whistleblowers to leave the country</strong>.</span> In sum, <span style="font-size: 24px;"><strong>Austria is well established and appreciated by any intelligence agency worldwide</strong></span> for their knowledge on torture and their <span style="font-size: 24px;"><strong>“initiation center for future world politicians”</strong></span> (Griggs, 1998) as well their <span style="font-size: 24px;"><strong>willingness to produce MK-ed super soldiers on gigantic scales</strong>, </span><strong><span style="font-size: 24px;">teaching these techniques</span> </strong>to other countries (latest since the Nazi physicians<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a>), <span style="font-size: 24px;"><strong>using the general populations´ brutalization towards children to strategically entangle</strong></span> more and more people, ongoingly still hiding behind the CIA coined term of <span style="font-size: 24px;"><strong>“plausible deniability”.</strong></span></p>

<p><strong>EXCURSUS | SOCIO-CULTURAL BACKGROUND:</strong></p>
<p>In a country where general <span style="font-size: 24px;"><strong>population has been silenced for centuries</strong>,</span> murdered for collecting cases of extreme torture and abuse of babies, toddlers, and children, <span style="font-size: 24px;"><strong>one has to consider to search in other disciplines, here history, high literature and fine arts</strong></span>, or research the “<span style="font-size: 24px;"><strong>blind spots</strong></span><a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12"><span style="font-size: 24px;">[</span>12]</a>”:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The oldest source for the German speaking countries is the infamous <span style="font-size: 30px;">“<strong>Malleus maleficarum</strong>”</span> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malleus_Maleficarum">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malleus_Maleficarum</a> from German <span style="font-size: 24px;"><strong>Dominican</strong><strong> Heinrich Kramer (1486</strong>) <strong>to legitimize to torture women as well their babies, toddlers, and children, stigmatized as “witches”</strong></span>, which happened all over the German speaking countries, so also in Austria; an exhibition is dedicated to this subject at Riegersburg/Styria/Austria, see <a href="https://www.dieriegersburg.at/hexenmuseum">https://www.dieriegersburg.at/hexenmuseum</a>, besides the <span style="font-size: 24px;"><strong>long tradition of Catholic societies in Austria, especially the Jesuits</strong>.</span> Psychologist and survivor <span style="font-size: 24px;"><strong>Fiona Barnett</strong> in <strong>Eyes Wide Open</strong> </span>(2018) describes <span style="font-size: 24px;"><strong>Austria as the military arm of the Jesuit order</strong></span>, especially in terms of (MK-ed) super soldiers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>More spectacular but with less proven – historical &#8211; evidence is the satanic ritual abuse within the <span style="font-size: 24px;"><strong>black nobility of the house of Habsburg</strong></span>, which reigned the country over centuries with a total population of around 50 Million in 1900.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 24px;"><strong>More importantly, because officially available in writings, the police states Metternich created</strong> </span>in whole Europe, so in Austria, during and after the time of the<span style="font-size: 24px;"> <strong>Congress of Vienna (1815ff)</strong> </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klemens_von_Metternich">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klemens_von_Metternich</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 24px;"><strong>O.T.O.</strong> – the Ordo Templi Orientis (1903</span>) &#8211; and several other powerful lodges have been <span style="font-size: 24px;"><strong>founded in Vienna</strong>,</span> guaranteeing that, especially <span style="font-size: 24px;">the educated middle class</span> (lawyers, physicians, authority officials, judges, writers, artists, etc.) gets <strong><span style="font-size: 24px;">strategically entangled</span><a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a>. </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 24px;"><strong>Several survivors</strong></span> point out that in Austria, since the times of <span style="font-size: 24px;"><strong>Sigmund Freud (more than 120 years ago)</strong></span>, governmental officials were told, that the first 2 children would belong to the state for (a long and hard torture based) education, <strong><span style="font-size: 24px;">in case they would survive, they would get jobs in government</span><a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a></strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 24px;">As much as we condemn the Nazis, also they did not grow like apples on a tree – <strong>questions here is still, who programmed them over MK ultra/SRA</strong></span> – most probably the Jesuits, see the connections from the Nazis to the Vatican, to the United Nations and back<a href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a>. <span style="font-size: 24px;"><strong>Despite of millions, if not billions of dollars in research funds</strong>, <strong>still not the happenings during the Nazi era, against political opponents, free thinkers, Jews, </strong><strong>especially against children, are exposed until today</strong><strong>,</strong> </span> <a href="https://traumabasedmindcontrol.com/index.php/meditation-fuer-alle-kleinkinder-im-3-reich-22-05-2019/?lang=en">https://traumabasedmindcontrol.com/index.php/meditation-fuer-alle-kleinkinder-im-3-reich-22-05-2019/?lang=en</a>, while the<span style="font-size: 24px;"> <strong>SS elite´s academy of physicians</strong>, which has been <strong>transferred from Berlin to Graz/Styria in 1941 never has been closed, conducting ongoingly bestial human experiments, breeding experiments,</strong> </span>etc. in the tradition of the vaguely known Lebensborn e.V procedures.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After WW2 there are <span style="font-size: 24px;">many references to Austrian sadism, brutality, and bloodlust, even lately in <strong>popular culture</strong></span> one can find many hints: <span style="font-size: 24px;"><strong>“Inglorious Basterds” (2009)</strong> </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inglourious_Basterds">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inglourious_Basterds</a> starring Austrian Christoph Waltz, playing a typical (psychopathic) Austrian; also <span style="font-size: 24px;"><strong>explaining the soul of this country in Jimmy Kimmel’s show about “Krampus”, see </strong></span><a href="https://youtu.be/VbkGuCozc9M">https://youtu.be/VbkGuCozc9M</a>; or <span style="font-size: 24px;"><strong>Andreas Prochaska´s </strong></span><strong>movie <span style="font-size: 24px;">“The dark valley”</span></strong><span style="font-size: 24px;"><a href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a><strong>, where an Austrian family clan </strong><strong>in the mountains</strong></span><strong><span style="font-size: 24px;"> terrorizes and impregnates every single woman of a whole village</span>;</strong> as well the descriptions of Austrian comedians, after President Donald J. Trump won the US election in 2016 – <span style="font-size: 24px;"><strong>“America First, Austria Second” (2017)</strong></span> within the comedian challenge worldwide to “welcome” President Donald J. Trump: <a href="https://youtu.be/itfs5G3UpWs">https://youtu.be/itfs5G3UpWs</a> <span style="font-size: 24px;">pointing to two facts: <strong>Violence, child abuse, and incest is normal in Austria, as well to the many MK-ed super soldiers in politics, competitive sports, and military.</strong></span></p>
<p>Not to forget <span style="font-size: 24px;"><strong>high literature</strong>: <strong>Leo Tolstoy´s “War and Peace”</strong> (</span>1869) <span style="font-size: 24px;"><strong>describing Austrians as morally flexible pervs</strong>, besides the <strong>several native Austrian writers</strong>, like <strong>Elfriede Jelinek</strong></span>, who won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2004 and is <span style="font-size: 24px;"><strong>known for her brutal heart and soul-wrenching texts about violence in Austria</strong>; <strong>Peter Handke</strong> </span>(who won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2019), <span style="font-size: 24px;"><strong>Hans Lebert</strong>, <strong>Thomas Bernhard</strong></span>, and the many others, <span style="font-size: 24px;"><strong>actually forming an own Austrian literary tradition within the German speaking countries, describing the horrors of torture, sadism and man-hunts happening in Austria on a daily basis up to present.</strong></span></p>

<li><strong>Short version:</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>&#8220;Ritual abuse can be defined as a colorful abundance of very different crimes, whose common denominator is ultimately only extreme sadism and a certain continuity and systematic approach. Noblitt &amp; Perskin, quoted after Hans Ulrich Gresch.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Long version:</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>“Signs of torture on the body of your child may indicate that your child is potentially a victim of satanic ritual abuse, also called SRA, or is a “training subject” of trauma-based mind control (MK). SRA can be understood as the combined application of physical, psychological and spiritual assaults. MK is mainly used in the military, intelligence and political areas, although the boundary line between these two forms of abuse is relatively fluid.  MK contains an abundance of elaborately devised, complex psychological strategies, ultimately designed to achieve absolute control over the thoughts and feelings of your child. Finally, i.e. at the end of the state-run MK programme, the aim is for your child to be conditioned to such an extent that he/she can be ordered to carry out actions that go against his/her human nature, when “wearing” different fragmented personalities (or “alters”) that are artificially created through torture, ideally without being able to remember carrying out those actions. The means employed to achieve that final state are physical, sexual, psychological and emotional torture. The ability and declared willingness of the perpetrators to subject their child to these kinds of mistreatment and abuse, when ordered to do so by the state, is what distinguishes this group of people from all other living beings on our planet. State-organised torturers are not interested in publicising their criminal actions, which go completely unpunished. MK torture perpetrated on a young child is not the result of a superstitious belief in witchcraft: it is consciously and deliberately planned, organised and continuously perfected. There is basically no part of your child’s body for which a “suitable” torture method does not exist. There is no element (water, air, fire and earth), no ideology and no tool that cannot be used for torturing your child. Clear your mind of the</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>propagandistic falsehoods propagated by western (criminal) cartel media that the torture of young children is only practiced in designated “rogue states”.</p>
<p>These crimes are of course kept secret. This is why it is ultimately very hard to find a definition that covers the “programming” of your child. Survivors describe it as an act designed to activate physical and psychological reactions to external stimuli. A person conditioned in this way is intended to finally be able to react in an intended way after receiving an auditory, visual or tactile signal (trigger), ideally without noticing anything about it themselves. If the conditioning brought about through torture is successful, the political system or network will have raised the perfect mental slave who carries out orders, without conscience and against all the standards of successful ethical coexistence. As the violence-induced raising of such a multiple personality ultimately involves the most serious violations imaginable of the child’s legal rights, in this area of crime the scientific overlaps between psychology, medicine, social sciences, philosophy, criminology and criminalistics are relatively fluid.</p>
<p>This final construction of a multiple personality outlined above is closely linked to the use of hypnosis. In the respective procedural modules, the programmers used, who are usually conventionally trained physicians, generate a torture-induced, selective intensification of perception in the child victim, whose attention in this respect is ratcheted up through the assaults. Due to the strained attentiveness thus induced, the child’s real state of awareness is clouded. In systematic collaboration, the psychopathic perpetrators described above open a way into the child’s mind by controlling his/her perceptions and memory, and by creating false memories. At the end of several years’ programming, the subject is able to obey like an automaton, receives all instructions uncritically and without question, and can carry out complex orders requiring a high intelligence, but is usually not aware of it all. In order to prevent people who are, from humanitarian motives, on the side of the tortured child from glimpsing the perfidious structures of the state-run torture programmes, false memories are implanted in the child victim and posthypnotic reaction patterns are instilled in order to produce false statements. This is why you should not be surprised if, when asked about the complex sequence of abuse, your child either maintains a consistent silence or behaves in a completely irrational way. The network of perpetrators is fully aware that, due to the ethnic heterogeneity of the police force, at least some police employees would not be indifferent to these severe violations of victims’ legal rights. Even though fully initiated perpetrators within the police ultimately cover up this abuse and actively work to prevent convictions, to</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>begin with the „Police“ organisation is simply too big for the group of perpetrators to control. One cannot therefore rule out the possibility that, when you initially report the offence to the police, you may get a criminal investigator who takes the concerns of the protecting parent seriously. The more importance this officer accords to the parent’s report, the more quickly they will implement urgent measures to search for and secure clues and to determine the evidence. During this important phase, the ring of perpetrators is not yet able to attain ultimate control of the course of the proceedings. Therefore the perpetrators’ strategy must be to implant the suggestion in the police investigator’s mind, through conditioning the child, that the child or the protecting parent is suffering from mental illness. Where fathers are the protecting parent, a suspicion is usually fabricated that the father is the perpetrator. However, SRA or MK can only be carried out by groups of perpetrators, i.e. by several people, as a single individual could never manage to do it. Usually, these protecting parents are quickly separated from the children concerned – without securing evidence of any kind – in order to remove further traces and to falsify the overall impression, and the young child continues to be used without hindrance – usually lifelong.</p>
<p>The following serve as torture methods before the programme units (quoted from Ellen Lacter, 2017):</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Rape: vaginal, anal rape, group rape, using sharp objects, weapons, etc.</em></li>
<li><em>Filming the torture</em></li>
<li><em>Verbal cruelty, mockery, making child ridiculous, laughing and enthusiasm as reactions to the pain and terror of the victim</em></li>
<li><em>Hanging the victim up, including with the head hanging downwards, in stress positions, during which they are tortured by spinning, etc.</em></li>
<li><em>Being fully immersed in water tanks filled with ice</em></li>
<li><em>Being buried alive with insects, snakes, rats, etc. with an oxygen source that is controlled by the perpetrators</em></li>
<li><em>Being hung up above fire or extreme heat</em></li>
<li><em>Extreme thirst and hunger</em></li>
<li><em>Leaving the victim in urine, excrement and vomit</em></li>
<li><em>Being forced to ingest poisonous substances<br />
Control of the victim’s surroundings – painfully hot or cold, dark or intensely bright, being</em></li>
<li><em>bombarded with loud noise, etc.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Mutilation, e.g. removing nails or fingers</em></li>
<li><em>Removal of body organs and dismemberment of victims kept in complete captivity (Ellen Lacter, 2017)</em></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All the information that the victim receives during these torture sessions (“programming”) is stored in his/her deeper psychobiological levels. Therefore, pay close attention to such statements when questioning the child. One special feature of this crime, not just from the aspect of children’s statement psychology, is that it will be suggested to the child that the adults are able to access his/her body at any time and/or to control the individual environment – and this often corresponds to the unimaginable truth:</p>
<p>Besides the known monitoring technologies in the child’s household, persons are also placed in the child’s immediate vicinity in order to develop a professed emotional relationship with him/her. As soon as this has been firmly established and the child can be successfully deceived into trusting that person, the child is then betrayed. The subsequent messages are clear and unambiguous: “We know everything about you”, “You have betrayed us”, “You won’t escape us”. Other “game versions” involve the child’s being told that an all-hearing microphone has been implanted in his/her tooth, or even a bomb in the stomach, which can explode in the event of betrayal. Adult victims have in fact been able to ascertain the presence of real, i.e. (in)active, implants through conventional medical examinations. Nowadays there is in fact the possibility of ensuring that dementia sufferers or animals can be found by means of (electromagnetic) pulse-controlled implants. An additional – though still less researched – aspect is the assumption that parts of MK programming as well as the use of triggers can meanwhile be carried out via microwaves and radiofrequencies.</p>
<p>As the silence of the young child involved is so important in terms of criminal law, the techniques to ensure it are practically innumerable: threats that their beloved primary caregiver (usually the mother) will be killed; needles in the area of the gums as a “training in keeping silent”; and wiping conscious memories through deliberately caused concussion, electroshock treatment and psychoactive medication. An additional way of ensuring silence is the showing of the pretended or actual liquidation of a “traitor”. Above all, witnessing a real murder makes a particularly devastating impression on the child. Killings in the context</p>

<p>of so-called “snuff pornography” (filmed torture, followed by the death of the victim) are also used for this purpose. It is likewise known that it is suggested to the young children that they have killed a person or else – far more dramatic for the child’s psyche – they have actually been forced to kill someone.</p>
<p>It is thus very easy to understand that you can only achieve a comprehensive account of all these circumstances with endless patience and absolute, benevolent neutrality. The child must deal with his/her shame about the fact that it has been the victim of a series of the most unimaginable acts of emotional, mental and physical violence and has thus displayed accompanying physical reactions and emotions, that no one has helped and that he/she was even laughed at by the group of perpetrators. These things have formed part of the child’s everyday experience. It is therefore your task to remain completely neutral during the questioning process.</p>
<p>Never forget the punishment with which the child has been threatened if he/she speaks out, which usually involves the murder of the primary caregiver or torture. The process of questioning the child must basically be done in several stages, and must therefore be planned to take place over a period of several months. <strong>As the investigators are generally left to their own resources when working out the course of the abuse as a whole, they must organise the questioning sessions themselves. If investigators know people with knowledge of criminology knowledge in their personal or professional circle (police detectives, juvenile court representatives, lawyers specialising in criminal law), these can of course be consulted and/or brought in too.</strong></p>
<p>The person concerned must be clear in their mind about what they may ultimately be getting into. Regarding doing it oneself: even a poorly planned questioning session is better than leaving the child alone with the abuse.</p>
<p>Although MK/SRA as a criminal phenomenon has, for obvious reasons, not been made a specific subject of study in criminological research up to now, its individual torture methods have been. Sexual violence perpetrated on a child in a private context has meanwhile been relatively well studied. Because the sexual abuse is a cornerstone in the process of programming the child, one can therefore use it as a starting point. It is of course important</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>to have an idea of the basic process of questioning a child victim before you start. Nevertheless, the essential difference here is that a child who has been through SRA/MK has undergone unimaginable torture with the aim of splitting their personality. The essential elements of this crime are therefore briefly described below:</p>
<p><strong>Phenomenon of the split personality</strong></p>
<p>The simplest form of split personality consists of a normal state (A) and the hypnotically controlled state (B).</p>
<p>Below: Visible change of personality in a child who is secretly enrolled a torture programme.</p>

Assumed posthypnotic command: “Whenever you’re near your mother, remember what you’ve done and said: if she knew, she wouldn’t love you anymore.”</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The change of the child’s personality is based on a posthypnotic command or a trigger. To do this, planning, a trigger and implementation are needed. An effectively instilled posthypnotic command is not aimed just at generating the outward behaviour of the subject – it also has to create inner mental states in the controlled human tool. Using inculcated key stimuli or codes, it is possible to condition complex operative sequences. The programmer can thereby also command the victim to forget the key signal again as soon as they have carried out the ordered action. This method is intended to undermine the police investigation of the crime outlined above. An additional obfuscation strategy is what is called “posthypnotic amnesia”. Here, the contents of the child’s memory are fragmented through mentally traumatising the child. This perfidious tactic is deemed successful if an outsider does not notice that the victim’s memory is impaired. To achieve this, during the child’s programming the method of fear-based suggestion is used. One technique is to plant the idea that they have a headache when they are inwardly processing the abuse suffered that day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Below: A child mentally processing the abuse suffered that day – a headache induced by suggestion, also called a “splitting headache”.</p>

<p><em>Source: “Luki” Dara Sadegh, taken by his mother Mag. Andrea Sadegh (now Riegler), in the summer of 2011, when the child had suffered the first flashbacks.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An observable headache can also be the result of an artificially induced neurosis, consisting of inculcated guilt or inferiority complexes intended to prevent the child from talking about their experiences.</p>
<p><strong>Why is it done at such a young age?</strong></p>
<p>Due to their highly imaginative minds, children can be more easily influenced than adults. In order to prevent prosecution, perpetrators exploit the fact that due to their still limited vocabulary, the child does not feel able to talk about the abusive assaults. Through the MK programming techniques a number of separate identities, called “alters”, are generated in the child. The group of perpetrators that installs, activates and controls these alters can ultimately also communicate with the respective individual alters. So that the child is outwardly able to cope with their everyday life, in addition to the alters, an “apparently normal personality” (ANP) must also be in place. The ANP is, so to speak, the facade for the programmed individual’s future role in the social system. The ANP, functioning as an outer shell, ensures that the multiple personalities finally remain hidden to non-initiates.</p>
<p>If investigators try to get the child to open up by showing him/her affection, a word of warning: perpetrators will deliberately create associations between natural interpersonal actions (kissing, caressing) or words (“love”, pet names, etc.) and dark threats against the child. You must therefore reckon with triggers deliberately implanted in the child to ensure that they are mentally imprisoned by an “inner guard” and their constant fear of the consequences of being a “traitor” i.e. of speaking the truth. The same applies to conditioning and hypnosis in connection with the initial routine procedures in a criminal investigation. In the presence of someone urgently suspected of being involved in the abuse, the child may for example in greet that person with joyful eagerness, while simultaneously rejecting their actual persons of trust, usually the protecting parent. Since enormous financial resources are available for the programming process, props, magic tricks, stage plays, special effects, film screenings, cameras and microphones are also used. The manipulation of the child’s thoughts is activated by means of roleplay and characters from fairy-tales or other adventure worlds (extra-terrestrials, demons). These are stored in the child’s mind linked to certain colours: i.e., during the programme unit concerned, the perpetrators show themselves to the child in identical costumes and colours. Thus, in time, it is possible to forge cross-connections in the mind of the child victim, which are accessible to the programmer through codes. For you, as an outsider, these are usually completely innocuous, everyday words or other triggers. Nevertheless, the child is prepared in such a way that, in the end, the “opening and closing” of the child’s personalities function appropriately. This process is considered successful if the trigger words have a certain rhythm and the treacherous word combination or other trigger chains are selected in such a way that an everyday situation cannot trigger a change of personality.</p>
<p>Multiple personality disorder (MPD), also called “dissociative identity disorder” (DID) is used in the international system for classifying illnesses (ICD 10), in this case concerning the psychiatric illnesses (DSM4). It would thus be a punishable offence for the perpetrator to deliberately create a sick person twice over (knowing the prohibition on simultaneous intention to perpetrate a crime and succeeding in perpetrating that crime).   Consequently, there is a causal connection between dysfunctional family integration, the use of violence, mental trauma and disorders when processing experiences. It is thereby necessary for the child to be placed in the hands of the programmers at regular interviews. The above-described mental trauma of the child is devised based on a process of “internally running away”. Since the physically much weaker child is unable to justifiably defend itself against the assaults and can also see no way of physically escaping from the location of the abuse, it must finally choose the path of mental dissociation. The rule of thumb here is: <em>“The earlier the traumatisation of the child occurs, the greater the probability of multiple personality disorder.” </em>A decisive point is thereby the extent of control over the child’s defence mechanisms. In the specialist literature, one finds different instructions as to the most suitable time for this. After dissociation and violent training, children aged two and a half can already display a completely split personality. Under the supervision of a physician, tortures such as pinching fingers with pincers, violent blows to the head, rapes, and having fingers painfully trapped in a mousetrap while being locked in a room, etc. As soon as the child stops crying and is only whimpering in pain, it is released. Then the child receives their aversion conditioning through commands. Not all stages are the same here. Meanwhile, the following main programming procedures are known:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Alpha: Basic programme – the aims are the unresisting obedience and automatic reflexes of the child</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Beta: Sexual programme activated by a key word</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Delta: Assassin programme, fighter programme</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Theta: Programme for integration in occult groups</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Omega: Obscuration programme with the aim of maintaining the split psyche of the child</em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A typical technical method for creating multiple personalities is “spin programming”, “spinning” or the German term <em>Rädern</em> which (appropriately enough) means “being broken on the wheel”. The child is strapped to a rotating disc, and through extremely painful centrifugal forces, their personalities are polyfragmented. This kind of programming method already begins in earliest childhood. The child can either be spun on their own axis – as on a spit – or turned in a vertical direction.</p>
<p>Here too, one must of course take the rapid development of new technical possibilities into account. Seizure-inducing treatments, CT, as well as the influencing of the mind by means of electromagnetic fields are used here, and are still relatively little researched in relation to young children. The special feature is basically that the programming of the child relates to the generating of personality fragments. Therefore, a specific message is always conveyed to the child during programming. While being questioned, the child may thus give you answers that appear completely incoherent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The same applies if you thereby observe illogical ways of behaving. However, when you become more familiar with them, these are always connected to commands instilled through violence:</p>
<ul>
<li>You deserve to be punished – we’ll find you wherever you are</li>
<li>No one believes what you say</li>
<li>You deserve the violence you have experienced</li>
<li>We’re watching you and can kill your parents</li>
<li>The police will come to get you – you’ll go to prison</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Subsequently building on this, in the next stage the victim is usually indoctrinated with the following ideas (cf. Ellen Lacter, 2017):</p>
<ul>
<li><em>You are evil.</em></li>
<li><em>You are a murderer.</em></li>
<li><em>You are an accomplice in crimes (often such scenes are filmed as evidence).</em></li>
<li><em>You are now one of us.</em></li>
<li><em>You are now a voluntary member of the network which commits rapes and abuse.</em></li>
<li><em>No one except us will ever want to have anything to do with you again.</em></li>
<li><em>The people who have been taking care of you can’t take care of you ever again.</em></li>
<li><em>No psychotherapist will ever want to help you.</em></li>
<li><em>The whole of the clergy will condemn you.</em></li>
<li><em>You are lost in the sight of God.</em></li>
<li><em>You now belong to: _____ (a god/goddess that demands blood sacrifices).</em></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Certainly, the most ruthless method is brain surgery. Here, the surgeon deliberately damages the healthy tissue of the healthy child. Another possibility is medically influencing the amygdala (the part of the brain important for emotions and feelings) using electrical current. Other surgical interventions (scars on the brain stem, etc.), and the removal and mutilation of glands, are also known methods.</p>
<p>The child often remembers the torture in everyday life in flashbacks, usually triggered by associations while processing the experience. It can thereby quite possibly happen that the child reveals the abuse at this very moment: the young child experiences the torture as if it is happening again.</p>
<p><strong>First of all, some good news: as soon as they have been able to relate one of the events in their entirety, the young child finds greater peace of mind: in every flashback or anxiety state, and in every recounting of the abuse, you are already helping the children to heal their unimaginable experiences to a great extent.</strong></p>
<p>Finding out about the torturers’ world represents a particular challenge for you, but is everyday routine for the children, as is the often-staged, seemingly “fairytale-like” world of Satanism: Satanic rituals and the procedures conducted in an MK programme can definitely overlap. According to Michaela Huber (1995), victims have reported the following methods:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Strange smells</em></strong><em> […]</em></li>
<li><em>Men in black coats/cloaks, hoods, <strong>masks</strong>, etc.;</em></li>
<li><em>Cellars, painted black or their walls hung with black cloths;</em></li>
<li><em>[…]</em></li>
<li><em>Rituals with oil, <strong>blood </strong>[…]</em></li>
<li><strong><em>Blood, that runs down one’s naked body </em></strong><em>[…]</em></li>
<li><em>Eating raw animal or human flesh, or <strong>faeces</strong>, drinking urine and blood</em></li>
<li><em>[…]</em></li>
<li><strong><em>Vaginal, oral, anal gang rape; being penetrated with sticks</em></strong><em>, knives, crucifixes, etc.</em></li>
<li><strong><em>Blows, kicks, electric shocks</em></strong></li>
<li><strong><em>Being locked in chests</em></strong><em>, coffins, water-tanks, etc.;</em></li>
<li><em>[…]</em></li>
<li><em>Loud, sacral or Wagnerian <strong>music</strong>, “sacral” chanting […]</em></li>
<li><strong><em>Extreme feelings of shame and guilt, the feeling of having to “sacrifice” oneself</em></strong><em> or of “being chosen to die”, to feel like “Satan” (or having “inner alters” who think they are Satan)</em></li>
<li><em>A <strong>vow that cannot be broken</strong>, otherwise someone will die (either they themselves or someone close to them, or their favourite animal)</em></li>
<li><strong><em>The exaction of punishments upon them and/or other children or adults </em></strong><em>who have been “disobedient”</em></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Invocations and curses</em></strong><em>; the feeling of being able to be killed by the words of a spell, etc.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Before starting a questioning session, you should therefore bear in mind the following patterns of reaction, which the child has already able to show an investigator or protecting parent on occasion in the past:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fear of giving blood samples, and of dental examinations</li>
<li>Fear of being tied up</li>
<li>Ritualistic chanting</li>
<li>Nervousness at meals (cocoa: faeces; red fruit-juice: blood; barbecues in summer: burns/scalding)</li>
<li>Wanton destruction of toy figures and dolls (mutilations)</li>
<li>Fear of “harmless” everyday objects</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>„</strong>DELIBERATE DISSOCIATION, OR MIND CONTROL<br />
<em>man’s inhumanity to children</em></p>
<p>Alters can also be intentionally induced. This sadistic act is sometimes called “deliberate trauma-based dissociation,” or “trauma-based mind control” and is usually accomplished by the use of torture (although young survivors report having been dissociated through the use of harmonics and other more technical means). People wishing to have total control over another person can use electroshock, water-boarding, drugs, isolation, sensory deprivation and other means to force their victim to radically dissociate, to push them past the limit of integration, leaving what can be seen, essentially, as a blank slate; a kind of place-holder, alternate persona for them to manipulate at will.</p>
<p>Once a victim is “split,” or “dissociated,” that part can be trained and programmed through post-hypnotic suggestion and other more technical means. This cruel art has been refined, over the centuries, to an astonishing level of sophistication.” (Carmen Holiday)</p>

<p>&#8220;Multiple personalities develop in children as a result of a correspondingly planned approach by adults. True multiple personalities are consciously formed by their parents with the direct and indirect (supervision) participation of professionals. These specialists are very familiar with the psychobiology of child development and adjust their measures to the respective stage of development.</p>
<p>Therefore, these are not illnesses that arise in the course of self-traumatization, such as a cold caused by an infection, but rather conditions during or after a torture-supported mind control.</p>
<p>-According to this alternative theory, the breeding of multiple personalities begins immediately after birth with a &#8220;love-bombing&#8221; that far exceeds natural mother love. After all, the children should have a solid basis so that they can endure what follows and not die.</p>
<p>-Then an unspecific dissociation training by torture, often in cages with electrical contacts on the floors, takes place. The torture is sometimes systematic, sometimes random. Central characteristics of the field of perception always vary. Colors can play a role, sounds, costumes, masks.</p>
<p>-If the child is a little older, a dichotomy follows, usually into a &#8220;day child&#8221; and a &#8220;night child&#8221;. These &#8220;personalities&#8221; are associated with different self-images and behaviors.</p>
<p>-If this works, there is a &#8220;triangulation&#8221; into the true self (personality core), the front personality and a mediating instance between the two, a mediator, who is also the &#8220;interface&#8221; for the perpetrators. This is the receiver for the &#8220;programming&#8221;.</p>
<p>-This is the foundation. Later, when the child is cognitively and affectively capable of doing so, the so-called brickwork is built on this foundation. This consists of derivatives of the mediator, which is split up for special tasks.</p>
<p>-The most important split is a pseudo-personality, which bears the pain of torture for everyone else. It is formed into a &#8220;battery of pain&#8221; and provides the psychic energy for the entire &#8220;operating system&#8221;.</p>
<p>-further split-offs can be, for example, prostitutes (including child prostitutes), soldiers (including suicide bombers) and &#8220;psychics&#8221; (for remote viewing experiments); here there are no limits to the imagination.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 30px;"><strong>This educational process takes place in a &#8220;virtual total institution&#8221;, which is a mixture of torture chamber, cadet school, and drama school and which is externally embedded in an apparently normal family life.</strong></span></p>
<p>It should also be noted that the dressage would not work if the perpetrators were unable to control the children&#8217;s social environment &#8211; be it through blackmail, bribery or on the basis of loyalty to the perpetrators or the system they represent&#8221;. (Dr. Hans Ulrich Gresch)</p>

<p><strong>TO THE DISTINCTION TO SATANIC RITUAL ABUSE</strong></p>
<p>Dr. Hans Ulrich Gresch &#8220;Satanic ritual abuse &#8211; facts and fictions&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Secret services are not cults, not even political cults, whose actions could or should be explained ideologically alone. This is especially true of the CIA, which is basically not a secret service at all, but the secret army of the President of the United States (Prados 1996). Its main task is not to obtain information, but to carry out covert operations. And the mind control experiments that were carried out on their behalf (Ross 2000) were supposed to help them to increase the efficiency of covert operations. These operations may pursue ideological goals or be justified by ideologies, but on the invisible fronts, facts determine their course and the presence or absence of methods to deal with these facts appropriately. Even the U.S. Army, which also developed mind control methods (Moreno 2000), is not a cult &#8211; and tangible military tasks cannot be accomplished with ritual acts. Rather, military leaders with responsibility for soldiers who bend their bones at the front look for methods that ensure victory while keeping their own losses as low as possible. These are universal military goals that are pursued independently of ideologies&#8221;.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At present, all scientists, therapists, survivors are in pioneering research, also changing the terms to date because of the growth in knowledge. At present, MK ultra is used as an umbrella term when secret services are involved in the creation of MK ultra soldiers based on torture, even though the official MK ultra program of the CIA has officially ended, i.e. continues under a different name until today, 2020. Satanic ritual abuse refers to the black magic component during MK ultra programming. The most prominent protagonist here is Michael Aquino, who in addition to his activities in the US military was also the founder of the Temple of Seth. In the USA there is therefore the technical term &#8220;military SRA&#8221;. Small local satanic cults have been able to carry out stable torture-based programming for centuries and it is known that secret services exchange information with these cults, as well as borrowing children from each other.

<p><strong>MK ULTRA &amp; AUSTRIA</strong></p>
<p>Already in 1998 [! ] the American, <span style="font-size: 24px;"><strong>Kay Griggs,</strong></span> during an interview with Rick Strawcutter, as an academic and <span style="font-size: 24px;"><strong>wife of a high-ranking NATO officer</strong>,</span> reported to the public during a series of interviews lasting almost 6 hours that there was a small group of Harvard professors, people from the Tavistock Institute and a <span style="font-size: 24px;"><strong>group of sexual perverts in Vienna/Austria, to research perverted sexual techniques &amp; practices on (young) children within these Viennese psychologists and psychiatrists and to pass on this knowledge, on an international level,</strong></span> also mentioning that there is an <span style="font-size: 24px;"><strong>&#8220;initiation center&#8221; for higher lodge degrees in Vienna</strong>,</span> for which (young) children are used. Kay Griggs does not yet mention (1998) the keyword MK ultra or SRA, but describes the events in Austria/Vienna in detail<a href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20">[20]</a>, (accessed on June 30, 2015: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8ly0c0_Rnk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8ly0c0_Rnk</a> ), as the cases of Jack Unterweger, Fritzl, Natascha Kampusch and most recently Sadegh/Riegler show: all the cases mentioned are MK ultra and SRA cases, not to mention the thousands of cases that have been hushed up (hush money affair Weißer Ring/SPÖ; children&#8217;s home scandals, besides the countless &#8220;single cases&#8221;) as mentioned already with references. Important for Austria is, that <span style="font-size: 24px;"><strong>many children out of </strong><strong>former</strong> <strong>Yugoslavia</strong></span> got used here in Austria, especially in Vienna and Graz, not only for human trafficking but for – ongoing – MK ultra programming up to today, 2020; <span style="font-size: 24px;"><strong>also here, no one takes care of them.</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 24px;"><strong>Historically, Austria is considered the military arm of the Jesuits </strong></span>(see Fiona Barnett, Eyes Wide Open: 2018), <span style="font-size: 24px;"><strong>followed by the first systematical human experiments in satanic ritual abuse around Dr. Sigmund Freud</strong>,</span> as well as the more well-known bestial human experiments of the <span style="font-size: 24px;"><strong>Nazi-doctors in the concentration camps</strong>,</span> as well in psychiatric asylums, here especially known in the German-speaking area, <span style="font-size: 24px;"><strong>Dr. Josef Mengele</strong></span> and the native Styrian, <span style="font-size: 24px;"><strong>Dr. Aribert Heim, who also programmed in the &#8220;Alpine Fortress&#8221; torture based MK in a long time after the end of World War II, as well in the US<a href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21">[21]</a>.</strong></span></p>
<p>Not surprisingly, the <span style="font-size: 30px;"><strong>Lebensborn e.V. facilities were never closed (&#8230;), involuntary impregnations, cuckoo children, hidden child pregnancies, etc. can be considered a standard occurrence in Austria</strong>, just like the <strong>in the meantime well-known manhunts of toddlers and children in former concentration camps.</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>MK ULTRA &amp; SEVERE SEXUAL ABUSE and TRAFFICKING</strong></p>
<p>It is urgent to point out that severe sexual abuse is a fundamental part of every MK ultra programming, therefore the use of serious abuse, as well as serious torture for SNUFF and child pornographic material, is the norm, as known from several international cases, see the academic, Psychotherapist and survivor, Wendy Hoffman (&#8220;The Enslaved Queen&#8221;, &#8220;White Witch in a Black Robe&#8221;), Cathy O&#8217;Brien (&#8220;Transformation of America&#8221;), Brice Taylor (&#8220;Thanks for the Memories&#8221;), Arizona Wilder, the hypnotherapist Miesha Johnston, as well as the psychologist and also survivor Fiona Barnett, to mention only the most famous international cases: in the entire specialist literature worldwide (has been submitted to the court several times), psychologists, psychiatrists as well as therapists repeatedly point out this fact.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Child pornography, as well as torture of (small) children, is a billion-dollar business worldwide, also in Austria, an industry which historically, comes along hand in hand with MK ultra research, at least since the experiments in the concentration camps of the National Socialists, and can easily be proven, and currently worldwide &#8211; pedocriminal networks, often with direct reference to SRA and MK ultra are being excavated by police units: Murder of witnesses, secret service targeting and &#8220;Zersetzung&#8221; (i.e. erosion on a soul level) of scientists as well as of survivors, however, is still the norm.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 24px;"><strong>To summarize it briefly:</strong> </span>Children heal extremely fast. To keep them in a state of shock (DID, PTSD) and therefore programmable, daily physical, psychological, sexual, and spiritual violence is needed.<span style="font-size: 24px;"> <strong>Sexual abuse brings in money and is de facto practicable everywhere.</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>SECRET SERVICES &amp; SECRECY &#8211; WORLDWIDE</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;We do know, however, that since the beginning of the Cold War, the CIA and the American military have been engaged in brainwashing research, among other things with the aim of developing methods to force people to carry out every order, and if it costs their own lives. It has become customary to refer to people of this kind as &#8220;Manchurian Candidates&#8221;; however, this is not the official designation of the CIA (Marks 1979).</p>
<p>A CIA dossier dated 25 January 1952 describes the objectives of one of these research programs, Project Artichoke, as follows:</p>

<p>The Manchurian Candidate is the answer to the third question. Were Manchurian Candidates actually created? A connoisseur of the subject, the American psychiatrist Colin Ross writes</p>
<p>&#8220;Studies of the Manchurian Candidate lead to the conclusion that the creation of an iatrogenic multiple personality requires much more control and influence than is possible in an outpatient therapy of one or two hours a week (Ross 2000)&#8221;. (Hans Ulrich Gresch)</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 24px;"><strong>Systematic and deliberate torture of (young) children is treason, slavery, etc., and therefore no one can commit these crimes without having the &#8220;security&#8221; of state institutions, public prosecutors&#8217; offices, district courts, </strong><strong>police commissariats, other authorities, above all from supranationally operating intelligence agencies<a href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22">[22]</a>, as backing.</strong></span></p>

<p>The principle of these serious crimes against humanity is also &#8211; freely formulated &#8211; <span style="font-size: 30px;"><strong>&#8220;to exaggerate it in such a way that no one can or will believe it&#8221;</strong> </span>and is this strategy known as <strong><span style="font-size: 24px;">&#8220;plausible deniability&#8221;</span>,</strong> a term coined by the CIA and, as is well known, immensely popular among MK ultra affiliated crimes:</p>

<p>Also, the number of murdered detectives, scientists, politicians, survivors worldwide is countless and unmanageable to count: Lifelong slavery &#8211; including sexual abuse, SNUFF, pedoporn &#8211; generates billions of dollars in sales worldwide, and the tendency is rising. <span style="font-size: 24px;">Even if the victims themselves are no longer &#8220;usable&#8221;, the &#8220;torso porn&#8221; and other amputation scenarios are known as the final step:</span></p>

<p>(The footage of the woman whose limbs were severed/amputated and who at the same time has a strap around her mouth, which allows her to be orally penetrated while her torso is standing on the limb stumps, has been reported to Interpol several times over the years).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These limb amputations are also known from the MK ultra Breeding procedures (note that the following picture shows a pregnant woman, about 5-6 months pregnant):</p>

<p>&#8220;6:30 am: Rounds at the birth mother area are done, with all students and trainers involved in this area present. There are currently 15 birth mothers in private rooms. It is month seven of the prenatal training, and all of the birth mothers look inhuman, with heads and pubic areas shaved; their teeth all missing (pulled out during torture sessions); and missing arms and legs due to the slow removal of digits, then hands and feet, then lower limbs, and finally the cutting off of the entire limb. Because of the healing technology, the stumps have healed well, but the birth mothers have almost completely lost their humanity. They have just finished eating breakfast, a nutritious mush in a bowl, which they eat out of like dogs on the floor since they have no hands to eat with. The birth mothers alternately howl and whimper as we come and assess the fetuses; they have learned to associate the presence of lab coats and trainers with inhuman torture. The fetuses are growing well, and respond positively on the brain scans to hearing the voices of their primary trainers, who they are completely bonded to since the emotional “leaving” of their birth mothers after months of torture which was blamed on the fetus. The fetuses will undergo their celestial city programming today, with visits from actors who represent the main controllers within the city, and a visit from the occultic “messiah” who promises to give them peace, safety and joy as they obey him. Later, “hell” programming with birth mother torture in a simulated hell will be reinforced.&#8221; <a href="https://svalispeaksagain.wordpress.com/a-day-in-the-life-of-a-trainer-2/?fbclid=IwAR1DHMknVt7NBvEFJYRG7mRP4llFj5Lr2N-bnm69LgAWOSzTZQLH6nz2CQE">https://svalispeaksagain.wordpress.com/a-day-in-the-life-of-a-trainer-2/</a></p>

The applicant/complainant, Andrea Riegler, was shown such women as a 6-7-year-old girl, here to obtain consent &#8211; especially for (child) pregnancies, as well as for genital mutilation. <span style="font-size: 24px;"><strong>There are several cases known worldwide, the &#8220;modus operandi&#8221; always the same: &#8220;If you don&#8217;t agree to whatever we want, you will end like this&#8221;.</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is no need to explain that MK ultra is based on &#8220;free will&#8221; of the (young) children, that a &#8220;contract&#8221; is obtained for each further step of torture and MK programming<a href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23">[23]</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It should also be briefly pointed out here that <span style="font-size: 24px;"><strong>these circles, directly from the authorities worldwide, make video recordings during these amputations and torture acts</strong>,</span> on the one hand in order to be able to <span style="font-size: 24px;"><strong>blackmail</strong></span> the persons performing them, for life, and on the other hand<span style="font-size: 24px;"> <strong>to intimidate</strong></span> others with the same material: <span style="font-size: 24px;"><strong>&#8220;If you do not do what we want, then we will do exactly the same thing with you/wife/your parents/your children”.</strong></span></p>

<p><strong>MK ULTRA &amp; ILLNESS</strong></p>
<p>New approaches to PTSD &#8211; Dr. Hans Ulrich Gresch</p>
<p>&#8220;The victims of the most severe traumatizations of this kind have only one chance to lead a halfway decent life. This consists of learning to live upright with the consequences. The basic prerequisite for this is to admit one&#8217;s feelings of hatred and thoughts of revenge.</p>
<p>In the early days of the human race, tribal members who in an emergency violated the commandments of solidarity in an unforgivable manner were mercilessly excluded from the clan and &#8220;sent into the desert&#8221;. The tendency to react in this way is innate to us. A severely traumatized person must not suppress these impulses. Forgiveness is poison.</p>
<p>If those affected are victims of violently implanted memory blocks, it is crucial that the memory gaps are closed as far as possible. In any case, those affected must try to verify the memories regained through memory work. It is disastrous to record them as so-called &#8220;narrative truths&#8221;, i.e. to leave them vague in the end. This is tantamount to re-traumatization, because the devaluation of relevant memories was also one of the perpetrators&#8217; goals.</p>
<p>The lifestyle of severely traumatized people is not a &#8220;mental illness&#8221;, but a variant of human existence that becomes comprehensible through the history and conditions of this existence. Additional psychopathological assumptions are not only misleading and superfluous, they are also an indirect exculpation of the perpetrators, because they explain part of the effects of the crime by a particular (usually imagined as inherited) vulnerability of the affected individual&#8221;. (Dr. Hans Ulrich Gresch)</p>
<p>(accessed on September 7, 2017: http://ppsk.de/posttraumatische-belastungsstoerung)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another <span style="font-size: 24px;">consequence of lifelong &#8211; PERMANENT &#8211; torture is DID (dissociative personality disorder) and describes the extremely healthy ability to &#8220;suppress&#8221; the respective acts of torture in order to remain highly functional. In extreme MK ultra cases, such as the with me, Andrea Riegler, as well with most of Austrians who have been in extreme MK ultra programs since birth, as well as in cases of MK soldiers who are active in the secret space program, one also speaks internally of &#8220;DID on steroids&#8221;. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The fact alone that I am writing the report here &#8211; in fear for my beloved son, shows the extent of this <span style="font-size: 24px;">&#8220;DID on steroids&#8221;</span> &#8211; compare also the 4-language website against torture on toddlers and children, www.traumabasedmindcontrol.com, which has been operated for years under daily danger to life (see assassination attempts since 2012ff) in horrendous fear concerning the beloved child.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 24px;">Cure can be found quickly if the survivors are left alone</span>.</strong> However, in order to do so, they can no longer be used, no more money can be earned on their backs, and governments worldwide prefer to <span style="font-size: 24px;"><strong>&#8220;keep the survivors in line&#8221;</strong></span> for the rest of their lives, be it through secret service &#8221; subversion &#8220;, legal proceedings, forced psychiatry, the use of (further) initiation rituals on their backs based on torture, assassination attempts as well as &#8211; if there is no other way &#8211; cold-blooded murder.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the same time, the &#8220;keeping in line&#8221; procedures ensures that &#8211; as a practical side-effect for the perpetrators/networks that carry this out &#8211; the survivors have little chance of recovering their memories, which have usually been erased extremely professionally and repeatedly since the age of 9. Known examples include deliberate concussions, drugs, electric shocks, introduction of false cover memories, further torture, et al., as well as this procedure leads to the fact that survivors usually have little time and energy left to report their tormentors/&#8221;handlers&#8221;/programmers/trainers/other personnel to courts worldwide.<a href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25">[25]</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 24px;"><strong>It is necessary to raise the self-explanatory question generally &#8211; of who is mentally ill here: the victims/survivors themselves or those who carry out the crimes, the representatives of the judiciary, politicians, crime commissioners, representatives of authorities and psychiatrists, doctors, teachers, etc. all over the world who cover up or permit these crimes, not to mention those who participate in them, or those who even earn their living from such crimes?</strong> </span>(compare in the Sadegh/Riegler case <strong>130+ inactive authorities and judicial representatives including ministers of justice</strong>).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 24px;"><strong>Significantly, in the Sadegh case, it came to daylight, that even PREGNANT women (mothers) were torturing the young Sadegh Dara Rubens in 2011, and shows that on MK ultra and SRA related crimes it is not helpful to watch merely out for male perpetrators</strong><span style="font-size: 16px;"><strong> or classic “Johns”</strong></span></span><span style="font-size: 16px;">,</span> as the perversion of human beings, when guaranteed no punishment but rewards, is seemingly without limits<a href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26">[26]</a><strong>.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Scientific literature suggests, that (most) of governmental officials, politicians, etc. are MK-ed (here in the “perpetrator” role for politicians and governmental officials) themselves or at least “entangled” within the known <span style="font-size: 24px;"><strong>“initiation rituals”,</strong></span> while they had to torture babies, toddlers, and children, which got documented via video, etc.: <span style="font-size: 24px;"><strong>Whoever is in control of this material, is ruling the world.</strong></span></p>

<p><strong>TO END THE TECHNICAL EXPLANATIONS ABOUT MK ULTRA</strong></p>
<p><em>Things I wish I did not know</em><br />
<em>Have you ever wondered why mind control and ritual abuse survivors all over the world report the same phenomena? (…) Because perpetrator groups collaborate and teach one another techniques of torturing children, splitting the infant mind, and training mind-controlled victims. It is organized crime. It is psychologically sophisticated organized crime. What else should we call it? Like the Mafia, it runs in families; (…) I did not realize the extent of the national and international organization of these groups. (…) I wish I had not learned that politicians are involved, including the world leaders. I wish I had not learned that some of my favorite musicians and film stars may have been involved, that the groups have a hand in deciding who rises to stardom. I wish I had not learned recently that some people who purport to help survivors, including some well-known therapists, religious leaders, and leaders of non-profit groups, are actually members of perpetrator groups with jobs such as spreading disinformation or gathering and silencing survivors who had escaped. I wish that Christianity and Judaism and perhaps other religions had not been corrupted and misused by perpetrators. I wish that various schools of therapy had not been corrupted and misused by perpetrators. I wish that therapists were not teaching self-help techniques which are actually program triggers (…) I wish I did not know all this. (Alison Miller, 2018)</em></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 24px;"><strong>THE CASE OF SADEGH DARA RUBENS &amp; RIEGLER ANDREA in a NUTSHELL</strong></span></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Since 2011ff, Andrea Riegler (formerly Sadegh) has urgently requested that her now 12-year-old son, Sadegh Dara Rubens (*20.02.2009), <strong>be evidenced-based medically examined via MRI/CT/nuclear-medical scans on the basis of serious suspicions that her son has been subjected to – ongoing – torture since at least 2011.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The reports of Dara Rubens Sadegh, which were sent in writing to the District Court of BG Hernals/Vienna, Judge MMag. Konrad Kubiczek and also the public prosecutor’s office of Vienna, prosecution officer Mag. Petra Freh, and also the police department of Wattgasse/Vienna, Manfred Miksits, Graz Youth welfare Department (CPS) and others – contained reports mostly accompanied by horrendous flashbacks of the then 2 ½-year-old toddler ranging from physical violence and rapes to ritual violence and waterboarding. In detail, these involved: rapes (oral and anal), the hunting of the child, use of drugs, use of medical torture (experiments with light, loud noises, destruction of the inner genitals, drilling/piercing the tooth root), ridicule &amp; mockery (being laughed at during the torture), being buried alive, being subjected to waterboarding, spinning, heat and cold (e.g. forced to wear a ski suit in summer), working as a child prostitute (ballet dress, swimming trunks, makeup, high-heeled shoes, customers, money), being conditioned using torture (the child repeatedly hits himself on the head with one hand, while pulling his hair with the other and practices “looking happy” and “laughing” by saying “ha ha”, while his carotid artery is visible over his entire neck as he tries to grin), sudden changes of personality, vows, pledges, oaths (satanic components) and near-death experiences: in sum, the then 2 ½-year-old victim reported physical, psychic, spiritual and mental abuse. Subsequently, even after the Austrian government took custody of the child, there were further signs of torture on him after 2012, as well as sensory deprivation programming in 2015, all of which became unmistakably evident during the supervised visits of the mother, Andrea Sadegh, to her son, and were brought to court even then – without success. <span style="font-size: 24px;"><strong>This kind of torture is known in the specialist literature as “ritual abuse” and also as “trauma-based mind control” or “MK-Ultra”.</strong></span> As a definition of this crime, which is always carried out under governmental protection, because of the horrendous lifelong injuries of the children, the following applies: &#8220;Ritual abuse can be defined as a colorful abundance of very different crimes, whose common denominator ultimately consists only in extreme sadism and a certain continuity and system. Noblitt &amp; Perskin, quoted after Hans Ulrich Gresch.&#8221; (quoted from https://traumabasedmindcontrol.com/index.php/chronologie-einer-vertuschung/?lang=en)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>In response to these (first) torture crimes, which are known in the technical jargon as <span style="font-size: 24px;"><strong>&#8220;basic mind fracture&#8221;,</strong> <strong>e. the fundamental split of personality of the affected infants</strong>,</span> who are usually highly intelligent and which are conducted before the age of 3, <span style="font-size: 24px;">the toddler, Sadegh Dara Rubens, who with one and a half years of age was able to recognize and name the letters of the ABCs and began to read his first words,</span> was not only <span style="font-size: 24px;"><strong>not examined by MRI/CT/nuclear medicine</strong>, <strong>but was separated from his beloved mother on February 13, 2012</strong>, and <strong>subsequently subjected to years of MK ultra programming and trafficking, which has lasted until today.</strong></span></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>while Andrea Riegler has been<span style="font-size: 24px;"> <strong>stalked, threatened, and declared &#8220;lunatic&#8221; by intelligence networks and courts since 2011ff, because of the description of the facts including </strong></span><strong>the names of the torturers present</strong>,<span style="font-size: 1rem;"> as well she </span><span style="font-size: 24px;"><strong>had to flee abroad several times </strong></span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">to escape further, even more, serious assassinations, poisonings, and other attacks, compare London (2013-2014), Asia, Switzerland (2016), Norway (2017-2018).</span></li>

</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>after <span style="font-size: 24px;"><strong>horrendous assassination attempts and poisonings in Norway (2018), Andrea Riegler &#8211; after years of assaults &#8211; is no longer able to earn an independent income</strong></span> and must apply for early retirement in Austria as of January 1, 2019. Only a few days later she received the pictures of her TOOTHLESS, then 9-year-old SON.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>When asking the District Court Graz-Ost what had happened to the child&#8217;s teeth in 2019, Andrea Riegler <span style="font-size: 24px;"><strong>does not receive an answer as a specialist on torture of toddlers and children</strong>,</span> but &#8211; just after a year later &#8211; finds out that a <span style="font-size: 24px;"><strong>handwritten application for lunacy because of her asking about the child&#8217;s teeth has been submitted to the residence District Court of Innere Stadt by the responsible family judge, Joeinig-Kogler, Dr. Elke</strong>.</span></li>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="7">
<li><span style="font-size: 24px;"><strong>The pictures, which show without any doubt the minor Sadegh Dara Rubens during SNUFF mutilation Porn</strong>, are <strong>ignored </strong><strong>by every single</strong><strong> Austrian Court, by Austrian Federal Police Units as well by CPS and the Supreme Court of Austria, while judge MMag.

</ol>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<ol start="8">
<li><span style="font-size: 24px;"><strong>At the same time, every single appeal, Andrea Riegler is handing into any court – </strong><strong>because of a handwritten note &#8211;</strong><strong> is ignored, so</strong> <strong>to have the family relationships examined via a family DNA test </strong></span>(Marianne Bretterklieber, formerly Riegler, maiden name Karrer, meaning the official grandma of the minor Sadegh Dara Rubens, is not his grandma, nor is Andrea Riegler the daughter of Marianne Bretterklieber. (compare the notes about hidden adoptions, coocoo children in MK ultra and SRA – more detailed information can be provided anytime). Significantly, Marianne Bretterklieber together with her husband Walter Bretterklieber as well the Uncle of the minor Sadegh Dara Rubens, Ing. (HTL) Riegler Helmut (together with his wife Nicole and their son Sebastian) got reported already in 2011 to the prosecution office Vienna, as perpetrators, present during the toddler´s basic mind fracture. Also, as ignored since 2013ff by Austrian courts Andrea Riegler asked again for <span style="font-size: 24px;"><strong>a fatherhood test, as the official child´s father – Farrokh </strong><strong>Sadegh Eslami &#8211; is an intelligence official</strong></span><span style="font-size: 1rem;"> who was sent into the life of Andrea Riegler to be able to start the strategic entanglement case.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><strong> </strong><strong> </strong></p>
<ol start="9">
<li>To ensure also, that the appeal for getting back custody of her beloved son, <span style="font-size: 24px;"><strong>especially with the knowledge of case procedures worldwide, </strong><strong>knowing that her son´s life in this highly explosive constellation</strong></span> – as since 2011ff <span style="font-size: 24px;"><strong>would </strong><strong>be in great danger</strong></span>, got fully ignored. In further cause, it was openly to observe that <span style="font-size: 24px;"><strong>the health state of the minor deteriorated, especially since Christmas 2019, as recognizable for experts without any doubt, merely on pictures and videos, provided from his soccer club</strong></span>, SV Hausmannstätten / Graz, who published them on Facebook.</li>

<ol start="10">
<li>Andrea Riegler, <span style="font-size: 24px;"><strong>after 10 years of intense research as well with accompanying therapies with US American experts, is not only specialized in the modus operandi </strong><strong>but</strong> <strong>on deprogramming, urgently needed by her son, in the meantime aged 12.</strong></span></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="11">
<li>The strategy of the courts is simple: <span style="font-size: 24px;"><strong>fatal or deliberate misinterpretations of courts, prosecution offices as well from “certified sworn psychiatric experts” are being – </strong></span><strong style="font-size: 1rem;"><span style="font-size: 24px;">without questioning – kept in the case files and considered as facts</span>, </strong><span style="font-size: 1rem;">new, </span><strong style="font-size: 1rem;"><span style="font-size: 24px;">additional evidence – as since 2011ff – completely ignored,</span> </strong><span style="font-size: 1rem;">focusing not on content or crimes, but on court and case procedures, to speak freely with Marshall McLuhan </span><span style="font-size: 24px;"><strong>„the medium is the message“.</strong></span></li>

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 24px;">This procedure is generally known worldwide – on child abuse cases alone, compare Catherine Ni Mhuillin, 2014:</span></strong></p>
<ol>
<li>The child talks about abuse – usually sexual abuse. The police conduct an inadequate investigation, claiming that there is not enough evidence to pass the case to the public prosecutor’s office, and close the case. The youth welfare office conducts an inadequate investigation, labelling everything as unfounded and refers the case to the family court, recommending the child be taken into “care”.<br />
2. Family judges appoint child advocates and/or psychologists to lay the blame on the mother by maliciously claiming that she is a liar/stirrer and/or mentally ill, and to recommend that custody be transferred to the father, who is – in their opinion – the “loving parent”.<br />
3. Judges minimise, ignore and conceal the evidence of abuse and rule that the mother is either lying/out to stir up trouble or mentally ill, and transfer custody to the abusive father.<br />
4. The judge isolates the child from the mother and from anyone who could confirm the truth about the abuse, while the children are conditioned to develop Stockholm syndrome and brainwashed by the abuser or by a “reunification/deprogramming therapist”, or at a foreign base, until they have either forgotten the abuse or withdrawn their accusations and consented to live with the abusive father.<br />
5. The judge ensures that the mother and her children can only see one another on supervised visits, during which neither she nor the children are allowed to speak about past or present abuse. As soon as anyone mentions the abuse, the supervisors send reports to the courts and immediately put an end to the visits.<br />
6. The judge issues directives forbidding the children to receive the kind of professional help that could support them in their disclosures, and also forbids the mothers to take their children to see doctors or therapists, thereby giving the abuser control over whom the children are allowed to see.<br />
7. The judge imposes a gagging order on the mother to prevent the public from finding out anything about the abuse, including its cover-up and threatens the mother with never being allowed to see her children again if she does not keep silent about the case and accept the cover-up.<br />
8. The judge disempowers the mother by driving her into bankruptcy through the judicial proceedings, by traumatizing her through separating her from her children, and by enabling the abuse to continue. („When His Eyes Turned White“, 2014, Catherine Ni Mhuillin)</li>

<p><span style="font-size: 24px;"><strong>CONCLUSION ABOUT THE SITUATION IN AUSTRIA</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 24px;"><strong>Supranational intelligence operations and trafficking networks are operating worldwide and are well connected with each other</strong></span> – see the many actual cases like Epstein, Hunter Biden, etc. who are <strong>very well connected internationally to – also – Austria</strong> and <span style="font-size: 24px;"><strong>cannot be dealt with statistics on human trafficking, ignoring bestial sadistic crimes against babies, toddlers, and children in the tradition of MK ultra and SRA, </strong></span><strong>committed on a gigantic scale, against native as well on foreign/asylum seeker´s children – worldwide.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 24px;"><strong>The Palermo Protocol seems to be extremely weak</strong>, </span><strong><span style="font-size: 24px;">if not combined with the Istanbul Protocol</span><a href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30">[30]</a></strong>, as babies, infants, toddlers, and young children are not able to express themselves or at least not like adults. Therefore, <span style="font-size: 24px;"><strong>evidence-based forensic medical examinations are needed worldwide to investigate the many forms of white and hidden (or not so hidden) plain horrendous torture against the little ones worldwide. </strong></span></p>

<p><strong>TRAFFICKING PROFILE – TIP QUESTIONNAIRE</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><em>Describe the country&#8217;s trafficking situation, including the forms of trafficking that occur, industries and sectors in which traffickers exploit victims, countries/regions in which traffickers recruit victims, locations and regions in which trafficking occurs, and recruitment methods. What groups are at particular risk of human trafficking? Are citizens of the country identified as victims of human trafficking abroad? Does child sex tourism occur in the country or involve its nationals abroad, and if so, in which countries? Have trafficking methods and trends changed in the past 12 months, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic?</em></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="color: #008000;">As outlined Austria is a trafficking hub, specialized in crimes in the tradition of SRA and MK ultra, committed against the native population´s children as well against children of foreigners/asylum seekers. The center of these crimes is focused on Vienna and Graz, but actually taking place all over Austria. Recruitment methods are “Romeo” marriages, meaning intelligence agencies are sending out male officials to marry women, impregnate them to then deliver the babies to MK programming. The Sadegh/Riegler case is by far not the only one. Also known are the threatening, bribing, entangling or buying potential parents and invite them to join, often combined with the promise, their children – in case they survive – would get high positions in government. Usual human trafficking with victims out of the former Eastern European countries (especially Bulgaria and Romania) is known, also here women are targeted to become mothers with children, usable for MK ultra and SRA. The pandemic lockdowns were massively used to ongoingly torture and abuse the children in MK ultra and SRA programs (compare pictures of Dara Rubens Sadegh).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><em>What was the extent of official complicity in trafficking crimes? Were officials—including police, immigration officials, diplomats, peacekeepers, military personnel—government contractors, or government grantees directly or indirectly facilitating or enabling trafficking in persons? Did they operate as traffickers, enable traffickers, or take actions that may facilitate trafficking (including accepting bribes to allow undocumented border crossings or suspending active investigations of suspected traffickers, etc.)?</em></li>
</ol>

<p>EXCURSUS:</p>
<p>To be able to understand the procedure shortly, it is unfortunately necessary to point out that these networks operate within the states worldwide via &#8220;fragmentation&#8221;, so not only the psyche of the affected toddlers and children is fragmented, but also the petitions for evidence and court proceedings. The Sadegh case is now in the following courts – dismissed, nearly always containing only one single sentence: <strong><em><u>“there is no initial suspicion in this case”</u></em></strong>:</p>

<td width="349">Being a former employer and “friend of the family” Soyer, Dr. Richard refused to overtake the case in summer 2011. Soyer, Dr. Richard was not even willing to talk to the appellant personally. In the meantime, he got his job as an university professor (manus manum lavat) as well, the appellant found out that he was the lawyer of the leading prosecution officers who were reported to courts already in the infamous “Natascha Kampusch” case. He is deeply involved in Austrian masonry/secret service/MK ultra-agenda. Both his children, now adults, underwent MK ultra perpetrator trainings.</p>

Wilfried was also denying to overtake the case in summer 2011, even refused to pick up the phone, while the appellant and her beloved son were in imminent danger. Besides being specialized on immigration law, he works for the Austrian Green party as a representative at the governmental broadcasting corporation, ORF: He is – for sure MK-ed himself, his father was a later Nazi doctor – seemingly much longer in the perpetrator role, than assumed by the appellant, but as these happenings were before 2002, they might be not of legal importance.</td>

<p>A-8010 Graz, Kalchberggasse 8</td>
<td width="349">Recommended in 2011 to the appellant, as this lawyer would be specialized in extreme abuse cases, it soon turned out that one of his best mates has been DI Glawar Gunther, the nephew of Kutschera, Dr. Gundl (both perpetrators in the Sadegh case, recognized by the toddler Sadegh Dara Rubens). After talking to Glawar Gunther, he decided to not overtake the case. His father Lehofer, Dr. Hans, is deeply involved in Nazi MK ultra in the city of Graz, in the meantime Lehofer, Dr. Bernhard, is overtaking cases to defend perpetrators, so of MK-ed sportsman Seisenbacher, Peter, who “accidentally” also “trained” the children of Soyer, Dr. Richard in Judo.</td>

<td width="218">Palkovits, Dr. Manfred</p>
<p>Law Firm Kafka, Dr. Erich and Palkovits, Dr. Manfred</p>
<p>A-1013 Vienna, Rudolfsplatz 12</td>
<td width="349">Took over the court case in 2012, recommended from an employer of the appellant, Matejka, Edith, who herself – as turned out later – is a personal acquaintance of youth welfare case worker Abel, Hildegard, deeply involved in the Sadegh case. Palkovits, Dr. Manfred handed into court – without permission or having talked about it – the waiver of parental custody of the minor. The appellant immediately corrected this “mistake”, then was mocked from Palkovits Dr. Manfred, that it does not matter, as there would be nothing lost, as the case was about nothing of worth [!]. Also, the responsible judge Kubiczek MMag. Konrad was mocking about this situation, while the appellant had to stay focused on her beloved son and his needs, already in the crisis family.</p>

<td width="349">This insurance company first denied representation of the appellant in terms of the Sadegh case in 2012, to then cancel the contract – in midst of the several court trials on 13<sup>th</sup> of April 2013. This unlawful behavior was reported to courts without answer. The founder of the ARAG law insurance company is a proud mason.</td>

<td width="349">Before, in 2013 after demanding from the ARAG insurance company to recommend a lawyer as no lawyer dared to overtake the case, Scholz, Mag. Dr. Gerald was recommended: He was extremely eager to get the Sadegh case files, to then – again – bring something to courts, what was not agreed upon: The former employer of the appellant, after the appellant was reporting to courts that Matejka, Edith was acquainted with Hildegard Abel, not only sacked the appellant without notice, but never, until February 2020 paid her the full salary. Scholz, Dr. Gerald was eager to confirm to the law firm of Palkovits/Kafka that the appellant, Riegler, Mag. Andrea would waive on the money, about 1.000,- Euro at least.</p>

<td width="349">This lawyer was recommended by the father´s rights movement and contacted in early February 2013. Well educated about MK ultra and SRA crimes, he was extremely eager to get all the case files, as well was spending lots of time to talk with the appellant, seemingly to get more detailed information. When a fixed court date was approaching, he suddenly told the appellant, that he was representing Kutschera, Dr. Gundl and her institute, so he could not meet the deadline for the writing. This betrayal, also legally wrongdoing caused the first “lunacy report” from which on, the appellant and her son were outlaws.</td>

Even passing the MMPI-2 test, and knowing that it is about to stop the torture against the beloved son of Riegler, Mag. Andrea, no further steps were made. Wagner, Dr. Astrid was involved in the infamous Jack Unterweger case, also massively related to SRA and child trafficking, as researched by the appellant years later.</td>

<ol start="3">
<li><em>Was there a government policy or pattern of human trafficking, such as in government-funded or -affiliated services or programs within the country or abroad? Did government policies, regulations, or agreements relating to migration, labor, trade, and investment facilitate vulnerabilities to, or incidence of, forced labor or sex trafficking? Were there examples of trafficking occurring in state institutions (e.g., prisons, orphanages or child foster homes, institutions for mentally or physically disabled persons, camps, compounds, or outposts)? If so, what measures did the government take to end such practices?</em></li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style="color: #008000; font-size: 24px;">The modus operandi of the Austrian government got outlined in detail. Key strategies were</span></strong></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="color: #008000;">there is no case</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #008000;">strategically entanglement of further judges, prosecution officers, physicians, general population (the more perpetrators there are, the better it is, as everyone entangled will try to entangle others or try to stop any form of investigation or prosecution)</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #008000;">torturing and mutilating not only my beloved son more and more, but also me (every single assassination was delivered deliberately on my brain, leaving me – <strong>as a former intellectual</strong> – with severe brain damages up to now).</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #008000;">reports of “alleged” perpetrators remained unanswered, so even their names are kept “clean” which is catastrophic for other potential cases, as they do not get any entries in the governmental databases for alleged perpetrators.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #008000;">Politicians, judiciary, ministries, media, and perpetrator networks are married or very well acquainted with each other.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #008000;">in case any problem would occur, perpetrators are handed out “intelligence” identity cards, to provide them with the status of being “untouchables”.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #008000;">massive targeting, murders, assassinations and “Zersetzung“ within most bestial “psychological operations”.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #008000;">many protective parents were brought into psychiatric asylums, or are under “lunacy” orders, with psychiatric assessments, more reminiscent of pieces of art, and which do not have anything in common with the statements of protective parents at all during the hearings. In the Sadegh/Riegler case, one psychiatric expertise from Lenzinger, Elisabeth Dr., included also suicide-trigger-commands, while Harvard based psychologists told me, the report about me is of such a bad quality, it cannot even get evaluated or nullified, as the quality of this expert opinion would speak for itself.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #008000;">Audio recordings of judges, governmental officials, or governmental sub-contractors which prove their rulings or statements totally wrong are ignored.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #008000;">The suffering of the beloved children – even during “supervised visits” &#8211; are ignored by “experts”, giving them electroshocks when desperately trying to tell something to their beloved parents (Mag. Birgit Rauchegger, MK ultra trainer present as supervisor during the visits with the beloved child)</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #008000;">on women it is known, that mass rapes are organized by intelligence officials, besides the common burglaries, destruction of personal property, and cyber torture, pc hacking, etc.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #008000;">while the suffering of the beloved children is played into the homes of the protective parents over white noises or are “treated” with cyber torture techniques.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #008000;">Summarizing: <span style="font-size: 24px;"><strong>“The more harm we do to you and your beloved child, the less anyone will believe it”.</strong></span></span></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><em>What proactive measures did the government take to prevent official complicity in trafficking in persons crimes? How did the government respond to reports of complicity that arose during the reporting period, including investigations, prosecutions, convictions, and sentencing of complicit officials? Were these efforts sufficient?</em></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="color: #008000;">Government sent out intelligence officials to target protective parents, as well as CPS to separate the tortured children from their beloved protective parents. After this procedure, the Austrian government – over courts and prosecution offices &#8211; systematically destroyed the parent´s lives (“lunacy” orders, hospitalizations, murders, loss of jobs, loss of income, loss of health, crippling them via murder attempts, etc.) while using the beloved children for SRA and MK ultra related crimes and trafficking or as it became visible in the Sadegh case, via further mutilations of the beloved child.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><em>Is there evidence that nationals of the country deployed abroad as part of a diplomatic, peacekeeping, or other similar mission have engaged in or facilitated trafficking, including in domestic servitude? Has the government vigorously investigated, prosecuted, convicted, and sentenced nationals engaged in these activities?</em></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="color: #008000;">Connections to diplomats (Frederick Lemaire, Azra Ziai), to politicians (Alexander Mitteräcker, the family of Martin Drapal-Angelo, Walter Klocker) or grand lodge masters (Alexander Kratky, Irene Kratky) or to the CIA (Gundl Kutschera, Stefanie Kutschera) or other intelligence networks (Kathrin Lauppert-Scholz, Gabor Tepper, Peter Scheer, Marguerite Dunitz Scheer, Walter Klocker, Johann Bigl) not to speak about the several university professors out of the medical field – just to mention a few – see the full list as known (as of February 2020) above. The government did nothing, as “there would be no case.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>
<ol start="6">
<li><em>What were the government&#8217;s major accomplishments in addressing human trafficking since April 1, 2020? In what significant ways have the government&#8217;s efforts to combat trafficking in persons changed in the past year? How have new laws, regulations, policies, or implementation strategies (e.g., substantive criminal laws and procedures, mechanisms for civil remedies, and victim-witness security, generally and in relation to court proceedings) affected its anti-trafficking response?</em></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="color: #008000;"> Human trafficking was not addressed at all: Reports in the mainstream media were focusing on the minister of justice, Alma Zadic´s, and minister for the constitution, Karoline Edtstadler’s efforts to create <strong>laws against “hate speech” in social media, meaning creating an open legal door to prosecute whistleblowers and scientists like me</strong>, while mainstream media has been applauding.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #008000; font-size: 24px;"><strong>Also note, where there are (officially) no cases of trafficking, no proceedings are needed.</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="7">
<li><em>Over the past year, what were the greatest deficiencies in the government&#8217;s anti-trafficking efforts? What were the limitations on the government&#8217;s ability to address human trafficking problems in practice?</em></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="color: #008000;">The government did not do anything. <strong>Shockingly, even the many help and support centers are in complete silence, intimidated, bribed, entangled, or worse.</strong> I offered government, police units, courts, CPS several times around 2016-2017 – free lectures on MK ultra, SRA, and trafficking crimes all over Austria, but never received back an answer.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="8">
<li><em>If the government had a national action plan to address trafficking, how was it implemented in practice? Were NGOs and other relevant civil society stakeholders consulted in the development and implementation of the plan? Did the government fund, partially fund, or not fund the plan?</em></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="color: #008000;">In addition to 6) and 7) <strong>my e-mail @traumabasedmindcontrol.com got blacklisted on governmental servers in October 2020.</strong></span></p>

<p><span style="color: #008000;">Despite of several warnings towards courts from my side, because of the dangers of child trafficking during the lockdowns, the government did not do anything.</span></p>

</ol>
<p><span style="color: #008000;">Austrian prosecutors and courts are not collecting the evidence, nor any victim´s testimonies. “There is no case, no need for us to investigate”, not even mentioning the reported perpetrators in their answer.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #008000; font-size: 16px;">In child abuse cases, no matter how severe or not severe they might seem, FIRST, it is necessary to examine the babies´- infant´s – toddler´s – child´s body from top to toes evidence-based via MRI/CT/nuclear medically: brain (scars on the brain stem), pelvis/tailbone, needles (teeth root canals, fingernails, palates, whole-body skin), beatings (foot soles), eyes, ears, drugs.  </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #008000; font-size: 24px;">After these procedures, social workers, psychologists, courts can take care of the children as well of the protective parents.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>In comparison: After a broken leg, everyone gets an x-ray and a cast.

<li><em>Please highlight effective strategies and practices that other governments could consider adopting.</em></li>

If not, why?</em></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="color: #008000;">The only cases that are investigated from time to time, are cases of forced prostitution with victims out of former East European countries. MK ultra and SRA related crimes are a huge (unofficial) industry here in Austria, with hundreds of thousands of households, who make their living by joining, conducting, or by ignoring these bestial crimes against babies, toddlers, and children. <span style="font-size: 24px;"><strong>The basic recipe to hide it is “to overdo it to such an extent, no one will believe it”.</strong></span></span></p>

</ol>
<p><span style="color: #008000;"><span style="font-size: 24px;"><strong>Traffickers, especially out of government, are rewarded with better jobs</strong> </span>(far above their educational level) <span style="font-size: 24px;"><strong>as well with badges or titles of honor, while those reporting these crimes are hunted over the globe, murdered, assassinated, crippled, or driven into suicide.</strong></span></span></p>

Did officials effectively coordinate among one another and with relevant nongovernmental organizations to conduct screenings and refer victims to care? Is there any trafficking screening conducted before deportation or when detaining migrants, including unaccompanied minors? Are interpreters available for screening foreign victims? If commercial sex is legalized or decriminalized, how did health officials, labor inspectors, or police identify trafficking victims among persons involved in commercial sex? If commercial sex is illegal, did the government proactively identify trafficking victims during raids or other encounters with commercial sex establishments?

</ol>
<p><span style="color: #008000;"><span style="font-size: 24px;"><strong>The government is doing everything to collect data</strong></span> (I several times got drugged by intelligence officials in my private flat to then find deleted USB-sticks, etc. besides my 24/7 hacked laptops) <span style="font-size: 24px;"><strong>to close possible gaps immediately and silence again everyone who even tries to find out more about the trafficking situation</strong>.</span> Well known – even private – help organizations, in need of money or MK-ed to act like this – are joining the intelligence agencies, in <span style="font-size: 24px;"><strong>counter-working against whistleblowers, scientists, activists, while sending out “fake” whistleblowers into the public.</strong></span></span></p>

<p><span style="color: #008000;">In MK ultra related crimes, it is again necessary to state here, that they are committed in “team-work” globally and are well protected by intelligence agencies as well are protecting each other extremely well. <span style="font-size: 24px;"><strong>“All for one and one for all”.</strong></span></span></p>

</ol>
<p><span style="color: #008000;">Austrian government is doing prevention in the sense, <span style="font-size: 24px;">that intelligence officials are sent out as private persons, to shut down whistleblowers after having taken, copied, or destroyed their evidence. <strong>All – massive &#8211; efforts are ongoingly directed to cover-up the crimes to be able to claim also in further decades to come “There is no initial suspicion, there is no case.”</strong></span></span></p>

Walter Klocker &#8211; to the Viennese prosecution office in May 2018, shortly after the desperate begging, crying and whimpering of my beloved little son – out of 2011 during his basic-mind-fracture &#8211; was played into my house via white noises: If I would not have found out what was done, I for sure would have died of a broken heart, unconsciously listening to the sufferings of my beloved boy 24/7 – or to be honest, would have gone insane. As soon as I found out, as well as soon I tried to record these white noises, they stopped immediately. Until today, I ask myself, how many protected parents died because of such forms of bestial “Zersetzung”? Shortly after, in September 2019 all adult teeth of my then 9-year old son were taken out, during satanic/sadistic festive days, known for mutilation torture crimes worldwide. Other bestial forms of “Zersetzung” which are extremely dangerous are, when torturers of your beloved child, veiled as “helpers”, from the intelligence are approaching you – here Johann Bigl – sitting in your home and having coffee with you. If you do not find out, you might break down on a soul level, as the unconsciousness or the soul knows it, and are these strategies known under “psychological operations” out of former East Germany.</p>

<p><a href="#_ftnref9" name="_ftn9">[9]</a> Crushing the testicles of boys is common practice in Austria, known to be conducted from catholic churches, as well as to destroy the inner reproductive organs with needles, of the boys, etc. Especially known is the destruction of the sexual organs (which leads to difficulties in having orgasms as an adult) on women – compare also the Epstein pictures, where girls are depicted with open legs, while fire is coming out of their vaginas. (…). In sum here, I would like to refer to <strong>Herman, Judith:</strong> <strong>Trauma and Recovery</strong> (1992), where she points out that torture or extreme torture has its limits, and therefore wherever you find torture, even extreme torture, it is similar, no matter in which country or century.</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref10" name="_ftn10">[10]</a> Severe mutilations torture on teeth, genitals, and brain are most common forms in Austria: Without teeth, it will be difficult for a child to enjoy food, not to speak about the connection of the teeth root canals to the brain. With destroyed genitals, it will be difficult to become children and is close to genocide, as well without sexual organs one will not be able to have orgasms. And last but not least, with a destroyed or deliberately crippled brain one will not be able to work or have an own career, later in life; if brain injuries are committed against adults (I am having severe neurological brain issues because of the ongoing murder attempts always targeting my brain – the latest in October 2020) they will not be able to expand their career and are shut down for good.</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref11" name="_ftn11">[11]</a> Well known are the Nazi physician´s connection to the United States of America, South America, Norway (the NATO leadership got practically replaced by former high ranking Nazis), less is known about the “Israeli-Project”, see <a href="http://israelirealities.blogspot.com/2007/03/mk-ultra-israeli-project.html">http://israelirealities.blogspot.com/2007/03/mk-ultra-israeli-project.html</a>, as well nearly nothing is known (officially) that the Nazi physicians did ongoingly MK ultra programming in their “home countries” so in Austria, in cooperation with intelligence agencies from over the world, including Russia, Muslim brotherhoods, Mossad, the CIA, etc.</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref12" name="_ftn12">[12]</a> These blind spots are referring to the many extreme abuse cases in the Austrian court system, which get archived with the catchphrases <strong>“diffuse trauma”, “abuse”, “alleged abuse”, or “mental illnesses”</strong>, to ensure no one is able to provide profound statistics. (If someone would try, we can assume that within the common intelligence practice, this person would accidentally die very soon after or in midst of this investigation).</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref13" name="_ftn13">[13]</a> <strong>Strategic Entanglement</strong> is a term to describe severe (torture) crimes or murder, most often committed against babies, toddlers, and children while being filmed to be in the hands of those who own this material. Formerly known merely in <strong>“initiation procedures”</strong> of lodges, intelligence, etc. governments worldwide tend to “entangle” also common citizens on gigantic scales at the moment. Most often the reward is a job position, money, or the legal status of becoming an “untouchable”, etc.</p>

<p><a href="#_ftnref26" name="_ftn26">[26]</a> Research suggests that these inhuman crimes of pregnant women might be part of the perpetrator training of their unborn children in their wombs. The Austrian minister of justice, Alma Zadic, a former child refugee out of former Yugoslavia, compare Griggs (1998), is pregnant at the moment, as well is ordering lunacy assessments for Andrea Riegler, instead of finally helping her beloved son or Andrea Riegler, while officially working on laws against “hate speech”, well connected to George Soros´ World Economic Forum´s “Global Shapers Community”.</p>

<p><a href="#_ftnref31" name="_ftn31">[31]</a> Here it is necessary to stress, that the appellant and mother of the massively injured child, Sadegh Dara Rubens did not know anything about MK ultra or SRA related crimes in 2011f, but realized immediately because of this group of perpetrators, the young Sadegh Dara Rubens was able to name, that something extremely planned and deliberately caused must have happened: Nearly all of the above-mentioned perpetrators do have excellent educations as well nearly all of them are in general highly intelligent. Also, this observation was reported to courts in grand detail, resulting in massive attacks from secret services, starting in 2011, when the young Sadegh, Dara Rubens was still living with his protective mother, the appellant, Mag. Riegler Andrea. Also, because of the massive fear of Sadegh, Dara Rubens it has been clear – even without scientific literature that this group ongoingly will repeat the torture on the child to intimidate and silence him. Also as stated by the child, as well by whistleblower Gudrun Hohenberger-Zwettler, there were many more perpetrators present, seemingly former partners of Mag. Riegler Andrea, therefore the list of perpetrators is far not complete, as due to the shock and panic states of the child, the appellant and mother of the child took (unfortunately) care not to overwhelm the beloved child with more pictures of possible perpetrators. The appellant found about the existence of MK ultra and SRA in late October 2012.</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref32" name="_ftn32">[32]</a> Also, the appellant Mag. Riegler Andrea wants to state here, that knowing that these perpetrator networks are ongoingly torturing her beloved son, it is extremely challenging to describe the torture-happenings in 2011ff in more details. All known happenings were reported in detail to Austrian courts and can get fully translated (where, when, how, who).</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref33" name="_ftn33">[33]</a> Every individual who has received torture-based MK Ultra programming has life-long scars &#8211; here especially coccyx/pelvis, brain stem, teeth/tooth root canal/palate, eyes, ears, soles of the feet, inner genitals, (missing) glands &#8211; which can be proven life-long by MRI/CT/nuclear medical examinations. Therefore, the scientific statements of the appellant, scientist, and mother of the child, Mag. Riegler Andrea, are entirely provable, unfortunately not a conspiracy theory of a lunatic.</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref34" name="_ftn34">[34]</a> As research results like the above led to severe attacks and murder attempts against the appellant Mag. Riegler Andrea, from multiple (supra)national agencies, is – without protection within a crown witness program not able to do more and in-depth research at the moment.</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref35" name="_ftn35">[35]</a> As self-explanatory, the bold numbers are the years, when the respective case started. Some of the cases are ongoing up to the present, some do have files up to 1000+ within one case.</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref36" name="_ftn36">[36]</a> According to governmental insurance files, the entries have been faked in terms of the appellant, Riegler Mag. Andrea: Instead of receiving antibiotics in 2010, it was written down, that the appellant has been there because of a beginning mental illness since 2010. Complaints and reports to courts in 2012/2013 (as soon as the appellant found out about it) were never answered. Since then, the appellant Riegler Mag. Andrea does not dare to go to any physicians, merely just in case of emergencies, practically she is deprived of health care, for which she has been paying for years, as every single visit with a physician, even for a flu, could trigger the next row of violence against the appellant, un-covering the participation of Austrian physicians within the MK ultra-agenda. The appellant, therefore, specialized even more on alternative medicine, which has to get paid privately, therefore is much more expensive.</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref37" name="_ftn37">[37]</a> Threatened the appellant several times. Is acquainted with several perpetrators, involved physicians, judges, intel officials, etc.</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref38" name="_ftn38">[38]</a> Was present at the opening of the new child protection center Graz in 2012/2013 with the cover-up agents Sollhart, Mag. Roberta, Drees, Mag. Renate, Walisch, Gabriella. Pictures from mainstream media “Kleine Zeitung”.</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref39" name="_ftn39">[39]</a> Stepan, Dr. Alexandra´s short expert opinion was changed and these changes were reported to courts. Nevertheless, she did not see any psychiatric illness on the appellant, Riegler Mag., Andrea.</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref40" name="_ftn40">[40]</a> Prehsfreund, Dr. Olga later was seen online to be a representative physician for Kutschera, Dr. Jörg (see Kutschera, Dr. Gundl) as well for the child physician from Sadegh Dara from 2015ff, Zotter, Dr. Heinz, who is a specialist on “sleep”-research at the Klinikum Graz. Sleep researchers are often MK ultra-programmers, specialized in psychic driving.</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref41" name="_ftn41">[41]</a> This from Tepper, Univ. Prof. Dr. Gabor, veiled as “Oka” according to the minor. Both the appellant and the child were thrown out of this dental clinic, the dental specialists refused to have the teeth x-rayed. The most shocking thing actually has been and still is, that the specialized dentists are very well aware of this kind of injuries, caused by needles, pricking the tooth root canals or the palate.</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref42" name="_ftn42">[42]</a> Dr. Lenzinger, Elisabeth is privately acquainted with perpetrators recognized in the Sadegh case as well with district judge Kubiczek, MMag. Konrad and tried to place suicide triggers within her written expert opinion about the appellant, Riegler Mag., Andrea. If Den Haag would consider investigating, it is recommended to clarify, how many court-ordered expert opinions of this psychiatric expert were driving its victims into committing suicide: Together with “Zersetzung” of the Austrian intelligence agencies, as well the suffering of the beloved child/ren it is for a “normal” protective parent unbearable.</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref43" name="_ftn43">[43]</a> Besides the appellant worked full time as a social counselor in 2013 as well she was able to prove everything she was talking about, backed-up even with scientific literature, he ignored her writings, therefore, she was diagnosed by him as “logically delusional”, which is not a legally valid diagnosis. He is connected to the Austrian secret service/MK ultra and also was eager to hear every single detail of the torture crimes, Sadegh Dara Rubens had to endure.</p>

<p style="text-align: right;" align="right"><strong><span lang="EN-US">MMag. Konrad Kubiczek, Viennese family judge in the Sadegh case </span></strong><strong><span lang="EN-US">concerning the horrific flashbacks of Luki Dara Sadegh, then 2 ½ years old, </span></strong><strong><span lang="EN-US">despite of having scientific literature on SRA mind control on his desk</span></strong></p>
<p>Satanic holidays have been mentioned in scientific literature on satanic ritual abuse or trauma based mind control [1] on one hand because of the confessions of victims, and on the other hand because of the registered crimes (abductions, rapes, mutilations of children) around these “festive” dates, meaning ritual abuse (physical, psychological and spiritual abuse).</p>
<p>Satanists are obsessed with rituals, symbols, numerology, and so these festive days overlap with the dates of all religions, which is one of the most important satanic/psychopathic characteristics, besides infiltration and silence, betrayal and deception. While holding solid, “respectable” jobs and attending their – official – churches, they celebrate their own “festive days” right afterwards.</p>

<p>The holidays, as well as the “language” of the respective calendars, is “old” and again underlines the centuries-old tradition of celebrating these festivals, together with bestial child sacrifices. The perpetrators, one remembers XAVAS and several other artists, do not usually dress up in devil’s horns, but are “in suit and robe” – that is, in highly respectable, bourgeois professions. These calendars also show how obsessed many Satanists appear to be with “sexuality”, preferably S / M – BDSM [2], as well as with body fluids (blood, semen, urine), as described in detail in the scientific literature on ritual abuse or artistically processed by artists such as Kim Noble, herself a trauma based mind control and ritual abuse victim. In his novel “eleven minutes”, the life-story of the Brazilian prostitute Maria, famous writer Paolo Coelho also outlines not only BDSM, but also reveals details of “holy prostitution / sacrifice”: power – powerlessness, sadomasochism (submission, subjugation), tormenting and killing “those unworthy of life”, especially “guilt-transference rituals”, as secret initiation rituals seem to be the main attraction for these groups. Due to the bestial crimes against children, in particular, one can imagine how many perpetrators want to break out of this vicious circle, as documented in the literature, but cannot, since they are caught on photos and video recordings and are therefore in the hands of the Satanists / psychopaths, and thus tend to conduct these festive days “in a spiritual manner” and try to seduce others to join.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Subsequently, one can observe the machismo of these networks, in which again only the proven stereotypes of femininity are allowed (witch-whore-saints), the feminine element is to be destroyed or suppressed, and also the obsession of Satanists / psychopaths with “interbreeding”, so that inter-generational “dynasties” are sometimes built in secret, in which women are used only as “breeders”, and due to potentially hidden cases of paternity, more people are in turn blackmailable. Due to the “changing of children” often mentioned in scientific literature, and reported by all former Illuminati and Illuminati-related persons – especially Fritz Springmeier, John Todd or Svali – intergenerational breeding can be better understood: bonds of flesh and blood are thus subordinated to the “satanic” goals. The experience of heartbreak, if it remains unreflected upon and unhealed, makes it easier to dehumanize others, and therefore to torture or torment also small children and babies. Again, this brings to mind the words of English specialists in this field: “No one wants to know that it’s happening next door”, because that means it isn’t a crime perpetrated “somewhere” upon “poor orphans” in a “distant continent” by “primitive natives”, but right in our immediate neighborhood in our western world. The bestial atrocities that people can carry out against other people, especially to children, simply take one’s breath away: American psychologist Colin A. Ross also states in his book “Satanic Ritual Abuse” that this ritual abuse is the most horrific thing that can happen to a child, as the damage is irreversible, and also explains why these atrocities must be concealed and denied at all costs: victims must be “disposed of”, as well as witnesses – “death to traitors” is the top priority of such groups. Psychologist Ellen Lacter describes on her website http://endritualabuse.org/about/overview-of-the-differences-between-satanism-and-witchcraft/ the different types of abuse conducted by satanists a well as witches (satanism vs. witchcraft): I have not yet been able to find any (specialist) literature on how, above all, these oaths, vows, pledges and promises of guilt can be resolved; this knowledge seems to have disappeared. In my opinion, this knowledge of how to revoke this ritual transfer of guilt, vows and oaths is “the holy grail” in the field of “ritual abuse”, since satanists / psychopaths are evidently able to change karmic / spiritual laws through rituals, i.e. to offload their own burden onto others. Interestingly enough, most of the people who deal with the topic, from the high-level Illuminati to the hobby esotericist, are convinced that one must have earned his / her “karma” by choosing it for themselves in this lifetime: these arguments can be found on Satanic NWO-pages (argued by high-ranking Illuminati), and is also propagated in esoteric circles as well as in teaching institutions for coaching, training and counselling, and subsequently I was told quite often – even by perpetrators in the Sadegh case – that the crime against my son and also myself was therefore justified. Besides offering the chance to comfortably blame someone else, this also enables another goal to be achieved – namely, to obtain the “moral” legitimacy to dehumanize the victims (even more). Nevertheless:No one has the right or permission to torture (small) children. No child in the world, no matter what their colour, their nationality or belief system, deserves this suffering. No child in the world should be allowed to be used sexually, spiritually, mentally or physically. Every single child must be protected from such crimes.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><u>Preamble:</u></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">At first glance, Austrian government/judiciary/intelligence/”deep state” inverted the Rome Statute, committing genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and crimes of aggression in huge numbers against 2 single citizens (a mother and her beloved son), while “strategically entangling”<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> a whole nation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">Considering the large number of Austrian victims over the last decade, which were either killed, brought to psychiatric asylums, forced to leave the country, driven into suicides or who lost their children due to governmental kidnapping, etc. (…) it becomes visible, that the modus operandi has been used widely and thoroughly in order to destabilize civil rights, gain social and political control, as well threaten and intimidate its citizens to keep them silent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">While the victims of this silent genocide here in Austria most often are living in a kind of diaspora, most often not knowing each other or threatened or intimidated into silence or massive fear, as mentioned above, it became well visible that the performers – here the Austrian government and its mercenary companies &#8211; are extremely familiar with every single detail of – especially – international laws, so with Public International laws and the Rome Statute.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">Due to especially the Austrian modus operandi in committing all these – bestial – crimes, it is extremely difficult for the victims, out of any social backgrounds, to find each other, to get together as well to take action unified, as infiltration, murder (attempts), intimidation, threats, “Zersetzung” (i.e. “erosion on a soul level”), gag-orders, hush money, etc. are the norm in this country.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">Those few who are incorruptible are most often targeted and punished via their beloved offspring – commonly conducted, well known from the Nazi era, via governmental child kidnapping – AND – torture of these children (either for MK ultra<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>, SRA<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>, medical experimentation, etc.) under “governmental” care.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">The Den Haag prosecution office, already overtook cases of German mass governmental child kidnappings in 2015/2016, therefore the appellant Mag. Riegler Andrea assumes, that the High Prosecution Office is familiar with these procedures in detail, very aware of the fact that these are no single cases in sum, worldwide, so also in Austria.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">It can only be assumed why Austrian government/judiciary/intelligence/”deep state” does need a strategically entangled nation, seemingly for further political and social steps, which cannot get analyzed within this appeal, as for such analysis a longer period of time is needed, no final conclusions can be made up to now. Some international experts who are observing extreme similar happenings worldwide are talking about an asymmetric warfare against the own population, others – specialized on MK ultra-related crimes – see a gigantic raise of MK-ed next generations, by strategically entangling former victims into becoming perpetrators<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>, which leads to (beside other facts) that they are deprived of any legal means.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">Nevertheless, back to the small and smallest ones: Over the last decade – especially because of the information exchange over the internet with victims, survivors or targeted individuals worldwide – it became massively visible, that more and more babies, toddlers and children have been taken from the governments of the Western World to go on in creating the MK-ed “super soldier” or the “Uebermensch”<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>, often taken from former MK ultra-victims or MK ultra survivors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">As victims/survivors of these crimes are deliberately isolated and massively controlled from early childhood on, most often matched with at least one “handler”, if not multiple “handlers”, therefore, it will be extremely challenging, nearly impossible, to find a “group” but thousands, if not millions of single survivors/targeted individuals, who underwent involuntarily MK ultra or SRA from early childhood on – this worldwide.<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a> Besides the high-level programming (“high functional MK ultra”) for later jobs in government, authorities, etc., there are common symptoms of the “fortunate” as well of the “not so fortunate”, who might were overprogrammed, lost their health/sanity during programming – meaning for all MK-ed ones: diffuse memories of childhood abuse, dissociative identity (disorder) or the ability to dissociate, Asperger syndrome, post-traumatic stress (disorders), depression, etc. up to severe multiple personality disorders, “schizophrenia”, autism or addictions, besides common health issues in the pelvis/tailbone/sacrum area, etc.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">Due to the life-threatening conditions, of those who talk or write about these issues, especially about concerned babies, toddlers, and children, i.e. the next generation of super soldiers later used in governments, in parliaments, in politics, in secret service/intelligence agencies, as future high-level academics in health care, in judiciary, etc. – estimations range from 3 to 30% of the population of any country in the Western world &#8211; the appellant Mag. Riegler Andrea is merely able to highlight her and her son´s own case at the moment, even though, the pattern or the modus operandi is the same worldwide, especially in involuntary cases<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a>, over the years many concerned protective parents admitted, that they were massively intimidated by the shocking Sadegh case, leading them to give up their beloved children, in hope their children would survive and be able to life their adult life without mutilations [!].</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">The “group” mentioned in the Rome Statute, to fulfill this task, is so to say: highly intelligent, intuitive, talented babies, toddlers and children (which often come from highly intelligent, intuitive, talented dissociated mothers and fathers), as well babies, toddlers and children out of <strong>intergenerational abuse<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a> families</strong>, which are there out in millions worldwide, do not have any protection against governmental crimes in terms of MK ultra, as governments worldwide, here Austria, are recruiting their own personnel within these MK ultra-torture-based trainings, to then have fully controllable politicians, judges, prosecutions officers, military forces, teachers, etc. as well governments are working together on a supranational level to hide these crimes, as so proven in the Sadegh case, where the appellant was targeted in every single country she entered (UK,  Switzerland, Germany, Norway). Due to the special history of <strong>Austria </strong>– Adolf Hitler was Austrian, the SS-ärztliche Akademie, the SS academy for Nazi physicians was transferred from Berlin to Graz in 1941 and never has been closed – there are numerous MK ultra-victims in this country.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">To close the preamble:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><em>Things I wish I did not know<br />
Have you ever wondered why mind control and ritual abuse survivors all over the world report the same phenomena? (&#8230;) Because perpetrator groups collaborate and teach one another techniques of torturing children, splitting the infant mind, and training mind-controlled victims. It is organized crime. It is psychologically sophisticated organized crime. What else should we call it? Like the Mafia, it runs in families; (&#8230;) I did not realize the extent of the national and international organization of these groups. (&#8230;) I wish I had not learned that politicians are involved, including the world leaders. I wish I had not learned that some of my favorite musicians and film stars may have been involved, that the groups have a hand in deciding who rises to stardom. I wish I had not learned recently that some people who purport to help survivors, including some well-known therapists, religious leaders, and leaders of non-profit groups, are actually members of perpetrator groups with jobs such as spreading disinformation or gathering and silencing survivors who had escaped. I wish that Christianity and Judaism and perhaps other religions had not been corrupted and misused by perpetrators. I wish that various schools of therapy had not been corrupted and misused by perpetrators. I wish that therapists were not teaching self-help techniques which are actually program triggers (&#8230;) I wish I did not know all this. (Alison Miller, 2018) </em><a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">Over the last decades thousands of therapists, psychologists, psychiatrists, researchers, witnesses, survivors – here from the age of 2 ½years of age up to 99+years of age – have been speaking out about the atrocities, carried out in any government in the whole world.<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">Latest here it is (again) necessary to stress, that MK ultra or SRA related crimes are committed by supranational organized groups, most often supranational secret services, even if the victims or perpetrator-victims may identify themselves as “Jews”, “Christians”, “Liberals”, “Right-Wings”, “Left-Wings”, “Nazis”, “Zionists” etc., which is mostly part of their programming, and gets latest visible in the (local) power centers, where all are working together.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">BACKGROUND FOR THE APPEAL:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">Since 2011ff, the appellant, Mag. Riegler Andrea, has urgently requested that her now 10-year-old son, Sadegh Dara Rubens (*20.02.2009), be thoroughly examined via MRI/CT/nuclear-medical scans on the basis of serious suspicions that her son has been subjected to &#8211; ongoing &#8211; torture since at least 2011.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">The reports of Dara Rubens Sadegh, which were sent in writing to the District Court of BG Hernals/Vienna, Judge MMag. Konrad Kubiczek<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a> and also the public prosecutor’s office of Vienna, prosecution officer Mag. Petra Freh<a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a>, and also the police department of Wattgasse/Vienna, Manfred Miksits<a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a>, Graz Youth welfare Department (CPS)<a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a> and others<a href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a> – contained reports mostly accompanied by horrendous flashbacks of the then 2 ½-year-old toddler ranging from physical violence and rapes to ritual violence and waterboarding. In detail, these involved: rapes (oral and anal), the hunting of the child, use of drugs, use of medical torture (experiments with light, loud noises, destruction of the inner genitals, drilling/piercing the tooth root), ridicule &amp; mockery (being laughed at during the torture), being buried alive, being subjected to waterboarding, spinning, heat and cold (e.g. forced to wear a ski suit in summer), working as a child prostitute (ballet dress, swimming trunks, makeup, high-heeled shoes, customers, money), being conditioned using torture (the child repeatedly hits himself on the head with one hand, while pulling his hair with the other and practices “looking happy” and “laughing” by saying “ha ha”, while his carotid artery is visible over his entire neck as he tries to grin), sudden changes of personality, vows, pledges, oaths (satanic components) and near-death experiences: in sum, the then 2 ½-year-old victim reported physical, psychic, spiritual and mental abuse. Subsequently, even after the Austrian government took custody of the child, there were further signs of torture on him after 2012, as well as sensory deprivation programming in 2015, all of which became unmistakably evident during the supervised visits of the mother, Andrea Sadegh<a href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a>, to her son, and were brought to court even then – without success. This kind of torture is known in the specialist literature as “ritual abuse” and also as “trauma-based mind control” or “MK-Ultra”.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">This crime, which, due to the horrendous lifelong injuries of the children, can only be carried out under state protection, is defined by one expert as follows: “<em>Ritual abuse can be defined as a wide variety of very different crimes, whose common denominator ultimately simply consists of extreme sadism, together with a certain continuity and systematic methods.”</em> Noblitt &amp; Perskin, quoting Hans Ulrich Gresch.“</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">(Source: <a href="http://traumabasedmindcontrol.com/index.php/fall-sadegh-ueberblick/">http://traumabasedmindcontrol.com/index.php/fall-sadegh-ueberblick/</a>lang=en – „Sadegh Case Cover-Up“)</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;"> <a href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17">[17]</a> <em>This continuity and systematic approach &#8211; as outlined by the psychologist Dr. Hans Ulrich Gresch and compared with his book &#8220;Unsichtbare Ketten (Invisible Chains)<a href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18"><strong>[18]</strong></a>&#8220;, which was repeatedly sent to the courts and the authorities &#8211; is escalating MK Ultra into the systematic torture-based training of future executives who are prepared for their respective jobs during their entire &#8220;childhood&#8221;. Regarding the activity profile of these MK Ultra concerned (MK-ed ones), the reading of &#8220;Svali&#8221; is recommended. Svali, the writer of several articles and books is a double academic who was active as a trauma trainer, officially as a teacher, in just such criminal networks, describing in detail career paths of MK-ed ones, depicting that MK-ed ones are needed in any level of society, in any profession, etc.<a href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19"><strong>[19]</strong></a>. Thus, not surprisingly, one finds world-wide in politics, media, management, authorities, so also in courts and public prosecutor&#8217;s offices and secret services an extremely high density of MK-ed ones.</em></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><em> </em></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;"><em>Due to the special history of Austria &#8211; since the Habsburg Monarchy the country was used as the military arm of the Jesuits<a href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20"><strong>[20]</strong></a>, alongside countless Masonic lodges (O.T.O. was founded in Vienna, among other happenings) &#8211; Austria has been a stronghold of this crime, most lately since the transfer of the SS Medical Academy from Berlin to Graz in 1941. This academy has, of course, never been closed, and therefore Austria enjoys international prestige in secret service circles (&#8230;). Austrian sportsmen, politicians, transgender programmed, university professors, priests especially out of the Catholic churches, etc. – there is not one area in which MK Ultra is not applied.</em></span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">Back to the Sadegh case:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">The young Sadegh Dara Rubens, who was able to recognize the letters of the ABC and name them as well was able to read his first words aged 1 1/2year old, identified and named 72+ perpetrators<a href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21">[21]</a> between 2011 and 2012<a href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22">[22]</a>, yet the appellant’s intensive research on the perpetrator networks led not only to a &#8220;governmental child removal&#8221; without a court order on 13 February 2012, without any examination of the young Sadegh Dara Rubens, as well without a police parade with the recognized and named perpetrators, but also to an &#8220;entanglement delirium&#8221; of the Austrian judiciary and school medicine/health care system. These actions were patronized above all by the Austrian secret services<a href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23">[23]</a>, while the appellant was repeatedly assassinated in a manner that threatened her life, both at home and abroad. These assassinations are ongoing and keep damaging her health severely<a href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24">[24]</a>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">In 2011/12, entanglements (between perpetrator networks and Austrian authorities) were already apparent, all cases and incidents have been fully reported to the Austrian authorities, so far without any result: this form of negligence and complicity is described as common practice in MK ultra-cases in international literature worldwide, more important for the appellant, this led to the fact, that her beloved son Sadegh Dara Rubens was never forensically examined via MRT/CT/nuclear medically/psychiatrically as asked since 2011ff:</span></p>

<li><span style="font-size: 13px;">Tailbone/Pelvis/Sacrum</span></li>

<li><span style="font-size: 13px;">Teeth Roots, Palate; Jawbones</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;">Scars from pressed out cigarettes on the arm/body of MJ, scars from torture on the soles of feet, hands, fingers/toenails from needles, etc.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;">Examination of the ears (deafness or loss of hearing)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;">Eyes</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;">in principle, of the entire body of the child, compare torture protocol for the medical clarification of (covert) torture by the &#8220;United Nations&#8221;, including internal organs, as specified in the &#8220;Istanbul Protocol”</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;">as well as for a psychiatric clarification regarding DID/MPD (deliberately induced dissociative identity disorder, multiple personality disorder)</span></li>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT PERPETRATORS IN MK ULTRA AND SRA-RELATED CRIMES:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;"><em>A lot of perpetrators are needed, especially for the “basis mind fracture” of the concerned children, most often toddlers. Basis mind fracture subsumes the first torture acts against the children, to receive as many “personality splits” as possible, to then later program these splits into fully functional “alter personas”, which do have different biographies, likes and dislikes, even different native languages, different eye-colors, etc. – a single person will never be able to create MPD (deliberate caused multiple personality disorders) on a child.</em></span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;"><em> </em></span><em style="font-size: 13px;">Perpetrators from all backgrounds of society guarantee that these perpetrators will infiltrate their personal as well their career networks to either influence general population or to strategically entangle their respective networks.</em></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;"><em>Well known from scientific literature but also from several whistleblowers worldwide is, that some are invited to parties, or huge (local) “celeb events”, where drugs are smuggled into drinks, to then later find out, that these drugs caused them to torture and/or sacrifice babies, toddlers and children. Either they go to the next police station to hand themselves in or – they are entangled for the rest of their lives, as every single act of aggression – mostly – against a baby, toddler or child is filmed in great detail, showing (drugged) perpetrators in action. Most of them will be asked to hand in their offspring for MK ultra later on.</em></span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;"><em>Many of the perpetrators are MK-ed or under SRA themselves. From time to time it is necessary to let them commit further crimes, meaning to keep them in the perpetrator role, as without getting triggers in their programmed roles, also perpetrators could find healing.</em></span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;"><em>Visible on this short list, representing the average perpetrators, that without the participation from employees from (supra)national intelligence officials – Austrian intelligence, French intelligence, Mossad/CIA, Nazi/CIA, MI6, Iranian, Belgium services &#8211; as well from the health care industry no such crime could get hidden in any way, as the affected toddlers and children do show massive signs and symptoms of being tortured – this during their whole childhood.</em></span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;"><em>The presence of toddlers and children of perpetrators is used to train them to become perpetrators on their own later on. This is necessary to hold down their victims lifelong, for the perpetrator parents this guarantee, that even at a high age, their offspring will take care, that they will not see courts or jail. So, also Sadegh Dara Rubens has been reporting that children had to injure him.</em></span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;"><em>Therefore, whenever MK ultra or SRA torture crimes are committed, one has to search for multiple child-victims (the appellant´s son was mentioning that he was not the only child who suffered torture crimes) as well in terms of the perpetrators, in case they do have children, one can be sure, that these children are almost always MK-ed themselves.</em></span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;"><em>It is necessary to state here again, that these crimes are also well-hidden because of their brutality, a “normal” human being is not even able to think of. Therefore, the more brutal these crimes, the better hidden they are. “Normal” human beings will not be able to read this appeal in full, as by just reading this appeal, they might be driven into post-traumatic flashback symptoms, or would rather suggest, that the appellant or any scientist dealing with these issues is totally insane. These reactions are also described by American psychiatrists, stating, that they – as specialists &#8211; would need therapy for themselves to be able to help their own adult clients during their childhood reports. On concerned children these happenings are even more difficult to bear, therefore millions of cases are most often merely reported as “sexual” abuse cases to authorities.</em></span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;"><em>Also, it is important to state, that these above-mentioned perpetrators almost always are committing ongoingly these crimes against babies, toddlers, and children, the young Sadegh Dara Rubens is merely one of their victims, as already stated. Therefore, it is not about shaming, blaming or “revenge” or similar low motives that drives the appellant, Mag. Riegler Andrea to mention their participation in the crime, but her duty as a loving mother and citizen to at least make it more difficult for them, to reach out for further babies, toddlers, and children, as well to give their own offspring the chance to break the circle of torture crimes and silence when adults.</em></span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">ACTUAL STATUS QUO OF THE CASE IN AUSTRIA:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">The appellant had returned from Norway in early December 2018, where she tried to build up again her existence to be able to support her beloved son, but had to return due to severe multiple murder attempts in Norway, partly conducted by Austrian secret service, partly by unknown supranational intelligence officials. She then received at the beginning of January 2019 pictorial material of her then 10-year-old son sent to her, officially as a letter from the child to his mother in which he wished her a Merry Christmas in January 2019 and further commented that he would be fine with &#8220;Grandma and Grandpa&#8221; (Marianne and Walter Bretterklieber), while the attached picture showed the not even 10-year-old child with all of his adult teeth missing. <a href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29">[29]</a>/<a href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30">[30]</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">In this letter the child also refers to his subsequently deleted YouTube channel<a href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31">[31]</a>, which contained videos from Autumn 2018 in which the child, visibly suffering massive pain and shock after torture because of his teeth, is not able to speak age-appropriately, instead of using a &#8220;German&#8221; High German. This use of dialect suggests his MK ultra-programmers are from Germany since it can be absolutely excluded that foster parents or even teachers speak a &#8220;German&#8221; High German in rural Hausmannstätten near Graz; even the appellant is only able to speak &#8220;Austrian&#8221; High German even though she is a Germanist and a literary scholar.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">A few days before receiving this letter, the applicant&#8217;s repeated research had revealed further close connections between perpetrator groups and the Austrian judiciary<a href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32">[32]</a>. As all of this occurred, further assassination attempts were made against the applicant, a scientist and activist against extreme abuse and torture on toddlers and children worldwide, who has successfully run the network against torture on toddlers and children for years, traumabasedmindcontrol.com.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">Whenever Mag. Riegler, Andrea does bring new (massive) evidence to the Austrian jurisdiction, either an “expert administration/expert lunacy” or murder attempts are following, while the Austrian court system is allowing known perpetrators groups to go on with the crimes especially against the child Sadegh, Dara Rubens, while Austrian prosecution offices are merely stating in written, that there would be “no initial suspicion”, therefore no investigation would be conducted – the health state of the child Sadegh, Dara Rubens is deteriorating massively according to pictures found online, most severe after the loss of – all – his adult teeth not even aged 10.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">According to the “Istanbul Protocol of the United Nations &#8211; Manual on the Effective Investigation and Documentation of Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment” &#8211; published 2004, “white” torture as well as mutilations – like taking out the teeth or causing the loss of all teeth via electroshocks, castration through the destruction of the inner genitals, etc. – are well-known forms of torture that can get tracked and traced one´s whole life<a href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33">[33]</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">While the appellant as a scientist was doing intense forensically research for her beloved son, Austrian courts were eager to either ignore her writings or to claim, she would be insane/would need an expert lunacy report – <u>this without having ever examined the child in detail over MRT/CT/nuclear medical examination/psychiatrically</u>:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">The first expert lunacy report was ruled as an “error” by the head of district court BG Innere Stadt/Vienna/Austria, Mag. Schmidt Ulrike, in 2015, after being able to prove that judge Dr. Zeitler, Michaela was faking court reports, nevertheless, all further evidence has been ignored so far. This expert administration came about suggestively in 2013, in that the Austrian courts never investigated the child Sadegh, Dara Rubens, and with no genuine evidence concluded that &#8220;the child had nothing, it was a well-supported, intelligent child&#8221;, and that the scientist and mother of the child, must be &#8220;mentally ill&#8221;. The child was never examined via MRI/CT/nuclear medicine or psychiatrically, and the countless applications for investigation, providing new evidence by the scientist and mother of the child, here the appellant, Riegler Andrea, were ignored every time. The application for the first assessment came from the Civil Rights Court ZRS Vienna under the judge, Konstanze Thau, who is married to the psychiatrist, Prof. Dr. Kenneth Thau: both also are offering psychologically motivated classes in their spare time and have been mentioned several times by protecting parents as &#8220;assessment administrator stimulators” – meaning as soon as a protective parent reports to courts and/or police regarding their tortured children, judge Konstanze Thau recommends an “assessment” of the protective parent:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;"><em>Here it is now indispensable to know that in crimes such as MK Ultra, medical doctors, especially psychiatrists, are always the main perpetrators. Without their professional expertise no torture-based programming, as it is called in specialist jargon, is possible. In the English-speaking world, there are several psychiatrists and psychologists who express their professional opinions on these practices, warning the population and governments worldwide against them. (compare above all the psychiatrist Dr. Colin A. med. Ross, who, in addition to extensively published specialist literature, has also founded his own institute on this subject, see </em><a href="https://www.rossinst.com/"><em>https://www.rossinst.com/</em></a><em>).</em></span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;"><em> </em></span><em style="font-size: 13px;">Contrary to habits of the USA, it should also be noted that in Austria the MK Ultra agendas are less in the hands of the military and the secret services, but directly in the hands of the Austrian medical profession and judiciary. This is to be attributed to the presence of the SS Medical Academy in Graz, as well to Dr. Sigmund Freud, one of the first known “MK Ultra” doctors here in Austria. The unlimited power of these two professional groups became visible in the Nuremberg war crimes trials, where practically not a single conviction of the medical profession was pronounced and not a single judge was convicted.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">In the Sadegh case, the suggestive circumstance has now<a href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34">[34]</a> come to light that the mentioned psychiatrist, Dr. Kenneth Thau, is even being promoted by Dr. Lansky Gabriel’s law firm. In the Sadegh case, this law firm represents “Jewish” perpetrators and is also known as the law firm of the deep state with close contacts to Mossad/CIA. Out of the 72 perpetrators identified by Sadegh Dara Rubens, 6 perpetrators are “Jewish” and this law firm represents 4 officially. Six such perpetrators are: Mag. Mitteräcker Alexander (son of the Mossad/CIA secret service agent Oscar Bronner, who is one of the best friends of former Federal President Dr. Fischer Heinz, seemingly in the role of an “Austrian Jeffrey Epstein<a href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35">[35]</a>”); Prof. Dr. med. Tepper Gabor; Prof. Dr. med. Scheer, Peter; and Prof. Dr. med. Dunitz-Scheer, Marguerite; as well as Mag. Scholz-Lauppert Kathrin and her husband, Mag. Lauppert Egon: the latter four suing the applicant under the patronage of and with the official Jewish Congregation of Austria, seemingly to make the appellant look anti-Semitic, what is a further crime, as she herself is at least 10% Jewish, fighting also for Jewish toddlers and children in MK ultra/SRA/child trafficking cases<a href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36">[36]</a>.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;"><em>For a better understanding, it has to be pointed out again that in MK Ultra the respective secret services stick together on a supranational level and execute orders from the supranational secret service. In 2011, the child Sadegh Dara Rubens already reported that officially &#8220;Jewish&#8221; perpetrators have committed torture on him hand in hand, i.e. together with National Socialist perpetrators &#8211; such as the Kutschera Institute, which has ample contacts with American secret services<a href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37"><strong>[37]</strong></a>. In her two books &#8220;The Enslaved Queen&#8221; and &#8220;White Witch in a Black Robe&#8221;, Wendy Hoffman, a Jewish therapist and MK Ultra survivor, also describes that, growing up as a Jewish child of a Jewish lawyer in New York/USA, she had already been sold by her father to Dr. Josef Mengele (the infamous concentration camp physician) in the early 1940s as a small child (long before the war ended). The technical jargon speaks of a cooperation between Nazi/CIA and Mossad/CIA, clarifying the cooperation of supranational secret services, since at present the strings always run together at the CIA. Others subsume this organization as &#8220;Illuminati&#8221;.</em></span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;"><em> </em></span><em style="font-size: 13px;">Besides the horrendous child abuse of the Catholic Church and the bestial human experiments of the Nazis, it has become internationally known especially in the last months that it is &#8220;trendy &#8221; among rich Israelis at present to book &#8220;torture vacations&#8221;, partly because of their own &#8220;MK Ultra revenge programming&#8221; (see &#8220;Nakam&#8221;), and partly in order to keep up with the “social developments” of a perverted &#8220;elite&#8221;, as is standard practice worldwide in all (“religious”) belief systems. In 2011, the child Sadegh Dara Rubens already showed signs of having been tortured in a (former) concentration camp; naturally, conclusions are drawn about the lively interest of the Viennese Jewish religious congregation in taking part as a joint plaintiff in the Sadegh case merely because they are named on the website www.traumabasedmindcontrol.com. According to international experts, these toddlers and child torture packages are booked and paid for on a flat-rate basis, and impunity is always guaranteed in the respective country. Hundreds of Jewish whistleblowers are currently desperately trying to draw attention to </em><em style="font-size: 13px;">the MK Ultra programming that is widespread in Judaism worldwide and Jewish victims are regarded as enormously important witnesses, worldwide, who even had their own publishing house &#8211; the Karnac Publishing House in London &#8211; as their mouthpiece until the sale of this very publishing house in 2017. </em></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><em> </em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><em>Back to the Sadegh case:</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">After the government-organized child abduction in 2012 on the grounds of an alleged &#8220;danger in progress&#8221;, (initiated without the presence of a doctor or judge by employees of the Youth Welfare Office Graz as well as the non-medical staff of the University Clinic Graz), the applicant was not only stalked by secret services but also psychiatrically examined only months later by Dr. Lenzinger, Elisabeth, who was sent from court to check the mental state as well the parenting abilities of the mother, without having seen the applicant together with her beloved son. At the same time, the husband of the certified sworn expert was affected by a repeated company bankruptcy, but more importantly, is precisely this certified sworn expert, Dr. Lenzinger Elisabeth personally known to the perpetrator circles (Mag. Alexander Mitteräcker, Prof. DDr. Gabor Tepper, as well former employers of the appellant) in the Sadegh case and was repeatedly brought to court by Andrea Riegler. Dr. Lenzinger&#8217;s expert opinion<a href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38">[38]</a> was submitted to American professors in 2015 and could not even be &#8220;nullified &#8221; due to the massively poor quality of the expert opinion since the horrendous quality of the expert opinion would speak for itself, as already brought to court by the applicant in 2012, since the expert opinion is more reminiscent of a creative collage than of an expert opinion.<a href="#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39">[39]</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">In 2013 it was proven that Dr. Zeitler Michaela, BG Innere Stadt, had falsified court records. Prof. Dr. Pakesch, Georg<a href="#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40">[40]</a>, a psychiatric expert of the Republic of Austria who is himself affected by MK Ultra, was &#8220;sexually&#8221; aroused during the descriptions of the torture injuries of the child Sadegh Dara Rubens in conversation with the child’s mother, a scientist and the applicant for this appeal, while he greedily sucked up all the details about the suffering of the 2 1/2-year-old toddler<u>. All courts and &#8220;experts&#8221; have &#8211; repeatedly &#8211; &#8220;accidentally&#8221; failed to verify the assumption that the child&#8217;s scientist mother was mentally ill by finally conducting a comprehensive examination of the applicant&#8217;s son in conventional medicine, as well as a police confrontation with the identified and named perpetrators.</u></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">While the child&#8217;s mother and scientist, Mag. Riegler Andrea &#8211; who not only has a profound education as a text scientist (master’s degree in Comparative Literature, German Studies), but also as an academically certified market and opinion researcher, trainer, coach as well as a life and social counselor &#8211; continued to hand in complaints with descriptions of severe torture committed on the child in governmental care after the boy was taken, as well as about murder attempts, (partly with handing in the names to courts when the secret service officials were recognized), since October 2012 accompanied by scientific literature on this subjects, literally every petition for evidence &#8220;stimulated&#8221; a new administration of expert opinions or the new evidence got lost or ignored, while the appellant’s beloved son underwent even more and more bestial torture in the Nazi tradition “<em>The more you speak the more we are going to torture your beloved child.” </em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">The fact that the applicant seamlessly resumed her job as a trainer in adult education &#8211; for the Austrian Ministry of Labor &#8211; immediately after the child was taken until the end of 2014 is particularly notable: if the applicant had been so severely mentally ill as described by psychiatric sworn experts in 2012/2013, she would not have been able to lead groups with complex backgrounds or to coach them, just as she would not be able to live and work in foreign countries (London/UK: 2013/2014, Asia: 2016, Norway: 2017-2018, etc.).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">The background of these “lunacy trials” are necessary to understand, that with them, the appellant – despite she is an excellent and internationally appreciated specialist, scientist and researcher – she was made deliberately an “outlaw” by the Austrian judiciary and health care system: Every act of aggression (rape, torture, murder attack, “Zersetzung”, poisoning, burglaries, etc.) are interpreted that the appellant would have “an episode” within her alleged “mental illness”. More important, as soon as the appellant is reporting to courts about the ongoing torture of her beloved son, so the loss of ALL his adult teeth (causing severe problems on a soul level, on a development level, also on a career level, etc.), courts are – ongoingly &#8211; answering with a “lunacy order” for the appellant, without ever having the child Sadegh Dara Rubens examined in great detail over MRT/CT/nuclear medically/psychiatrically – this since 2011ff – or with the one and only sentence “there would be no initial suspicion in this case”<a href="#_ftn41" name="_ftnref41">[41]</a>/<a href="#_ftn42" name="_ftnref42">[42]</a>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">EXCURSUS:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">To be able to understand the procedure shortly, it is, unfortunately, necessary to point out that these networks operate within the states worldwide via &#8220;fragmentation&#8221;, so not only the psyche of the affected toddlers and children is fragmented, but also the petitions for evidence and court proceedings. The Sadegh case is now in the following courts – dismissed, nearly always containing only one single sentence: <strong><em><u>“there is no initial suspicion in this case”</u></em></strong>:</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">EXCURSUS: STRATEGICAL ENTANGLEMENT I)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">More than <strong>130+</strong> government and court employees, i.e. judges and public prosecutors, have been &#8220;occupied&#8221; with the Sadegh case since 2011ff, while the child, Sadegh Dara Rubens &#8211; who is at the center and has always been &#8211; is subjected to further ritual torture as well as to MK Ultra. To this date, the child <u>has never been examined by means of a profound classic medical clarification via MRT/CT/nuclear medicine.</u></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">This procedure, (which resembles an unparalleled spectacle of justice in Austria, and has already caused and continues to cause international attention as a &#8220;major international case&#8221; in the opinion of international experts), also has a deeper background: <u>the strategic entanglement as already communicated to the courts since 2011ff. Highly educated Austrian judges and medical doctors are not stupid &#8211; the case serves to ongoingly entangle judges and authority officials, as well youth welfare employees, police officers to pre-school teachers and schools, further medical doctors, etc</u>.<a href="#_ftn44" name="_ftnref44">[44]</a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">Years of research and discussions with experts have clearly revealed that in the Sadegh case everything had been planned for decades, which also explains the high proportion of perpetrators from former friends and acquaintances of the appellant, Mag. Riegler Andrea. These perpetrators had already been recognized and named by the child Sadegh Dara Rubens after being tortured by them in 2011.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">A mentally ill patient would have been brought to a psychiatric asylum for good, would not have been able to do excellent research or even writing down the findings on <a href="http://www.traumabasedmindcontrol.com">www.traumabasedmindcontrol.com</a>, as well would not have been able to live in foreign countries, work, etc., also, a “normal” citizen, would not have been able to survive these bestial cruelties, as often stated by specialists but also by acquaintances:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">The appellant Riegler Andrea is a former MK Ultra victim, who has been used for years &#8211; like most of the victims, without knowing it &#8211; for top-class secret service operations without payment and without consent, here mainly by the Austrian and US intelligence services and/or their mercenary companies. Afterward, she was used for the creation of an international case of strategic entanglement on the back of the beloved child: she had a childhood in the MK Ultra program, years of torture-based training, especially high-level academic (MK Ultra &#8220;Thule programming&#8221; as well as &#8220;Wewelsburg programming&#8221;), to then be involuntarily inseminated with the semen from an unknown person<a href="#_ftn45" name="_ftnref45">[45]</a> by an intelligence agent who pretended to be a loving partner/husband, Sadegh-Eslami Farrokh. Subsequently the beloved child of the applicant &#8211; as usual &#8211; was kidnapped and transferred as &#8220;secret service/intel property&#8221; for MK Ultra, which includes torture and years of drill. Multiple applications for paternity tests have already been ignored in the judge&#8217;s office of MMag Konrad Kubiczek of BG Hernals/Vienna, who himself is deeply involved in the Sadegh case. The question arises as to why this very judge, who presented himself as the &#8220;father&#8221; towards the child in 2011, has strictly refused this paternity test, and since then no other court has wanted to carry out this paternity test.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;"><em>It is important to remember here that these children are filmed during torture and during these &#8220;sadistic&#8221; rituals, as are the participants, meaning the perpetrators.</em></span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;"><em>It is known from specialist literature that during torture rituals the &#8220;real&#8221; biological fathers present themselves to the children as their &#8220;fathers&#8221;, telling the children the truth about the &#8220;real biological genetic&#8221; paternity, which leads to a horrendous confusion of the little ones (&#8230;). To add also here, children are exchanged from birth on without any notice on the birth certificate as well as cuckoo children are the norm, most often without the knowing and consent of the mothers.</em></span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;"><em>It</em> <em>is well known in the specialist literature that politicians, as well as the leaders of corporations, the media, etc., have to take part in these torture rituals on toddlers and children before they receive these positions and jobs in order to be in the hands of the actual rulers, often called &#8220;shadow government&#8221; or &#8220;deep state&#8221;. (Compare Epstein case, the case of Ronald Bernard, etc.). From these actual cases it is also known that in the upper ranks, children must be fathered as a kind of demonstration of courage and power in order to be accepted into the 33+ degrees.</em></span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;"><em> </em></span><em style="font-size: 13px;">It is also necessary to remind here, that to keep MK Ultra victims with perpetrator programming in the respective programming again and again &#8211; via further crimes &#8211; because otherwise, they could find healing. For this, MK Ultra &#8220;victims&#8221; are needed, who have to be tortured, stalked and in any case kept existentially low by perpetrators as well as by their offspring for the rest of their lives, and also explains the usual manhunts. It is therefore not surprising that the child Sadegh Dara Rubens also reported on manhunts against him in 2011, as well as on the fact that even toddlers and children known to him personally were present at the torture acts and must have made him &#8220;ouch&#8221; (see charges against Riegler Sebastian, Angelo Sarah, as well as against the children of Gudrun Hohenberger Zwettler). Subsequently, the children of the perpetrators as adults are responsible for ensuring that the victims remain silent forever.</em></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;"><em>Many Austrian politicians, judges and public prosecutors are affected by this form of violence in the tradition of MK ultra, as are their international colleagues. The bestial cruelty with which the Austrian judiciary has left the highly talented and intelligent child Sadegh Dara Rubens to himself and to his torturers since his infancy bears witness to the state of MK -ed ones within the Austrian judiciary: Judges and Prosecution officers under MK Ultra either cannot look into the case, because the child&#8217;s suffering unconsciously reminds them of their own suffering, or do not want to look, because they have been programmed to be perpetrators. </em></span></li>

<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">CONCLUSION:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">Austria is a hotspot of MK Ultra due to the National Socialist home base, as well as the Jesuit military base. There is no other country of the world where the density of people affected by MK Ultra is so high, especially among officials &#8211; as numerous witness statements historically prove<a href="#_ftn55" name="_ftnref55">[55]</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">In no other country in the world do psychiatrists have such access and influence on the lives and thinking of ordinary citizens, which has led to more and more corruption, open torture of small children (compare, alongside the Sadegh case, the hush money affair of the &#8220;Weisser Ring&#8221; and the &#8220;SPÖ&#8221; (Austrian Socialist Party) with more than 2.000 infants affected by torture in 2013/2014<a href="#_ftn56" name="_ftnref56">[56]</a>) and most recently to the dissolution of the Austrian government &#8211; see &#8220;Ibiza affair<a href="#_ftn57" name="_ftnref57">[57]</a>&#8220;. This country is therefore extremely attractive for international secret services which, as briefly explained, cooperate on a supranational level &#8211; in the Sadegh case above all visible as Nazi/CIA and Mossad/CIA, as well as for &#8220;child porn torture tourism&#8221;.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">Nonetheless, torture and slavery are extremely serious crimes that are not subject to a statute of limitations in Austria, therefore the appellant is calling the Den Haag prosecution office as Austrian courts are unlikely to sentence themselves for genocide/crimes against humanity. <u>Also, it is more cost-efficient for the Austrian government to pay for further murder assassinations and torture crimes than to pay for damages and reparations</u>: Lifelong torture, lifelong exploitation and &#8220;manhunts&#8221; by secret services or special units of secret services, sabotage of de facto all professional careers, destruction of property, health, insemination with the semen of an unknown person (applications for evidence on the &#8220;biological&#8221; father can be submitted in particular, also with names) during upright marriage/partnership with a secret service employee, governmental abduction and destruction of the child for MK Ultra, years of torture, neurological damage by laser weapons and microwave weapons, poisoning, in addition to mental “erosion” via techniques of &#8220;operative psychology&#8221; (e.g. the desperate begging for help and the crying for his mum of her beloved son was played even into her short-term home in Norway via white noises), known primarily under &#8220;Zersetzung&#8221;, which can kill a victim, as it is – for a human being and loving mother – nearly not bearable. Everyone not under MK ultra and programmed for this role, like the appellant, would commit suicide<a href="#_ftn58" name="_ftnref58">[58]</a>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">Some international specialists also suggest, that the role the appellant, Riegler Mag. Andrea is forced to fulfill, because of her beloved son, is also used to “promote” this kind of Austrian MK ultra super-soldier program and later “sell” her type of MK ultra-programming internationally, to force other small toddler girls into the same or similar paths<a href="#_ftn59" name="_ftnref59">[59]</a>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><u>A complete investigation of the child via MRI/CT/nuclear medicine, including a police parade with the 72+ named and known perpetrators (out of health care, secret service, mainstream media, with close ties to politics), would have solved the case completely as early as 2011</u>. Without detailed examinations of the child Sadegh Dara Rubens, the courts have been turning in circles for years now &#8211; at the taxpayers&#8217; expense &#8211; and allowing the further destruction/mutilations of the child (compare – all &#8211; the missing adult teeth of the child not even 10 years old) as well as the destruction of the child&#8217;s mother and scientist, Mag. Riegler Andrea, who is currently (?) in early retirement for health reasons (neurological issues), after the survival of several murder attempts.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">More importantly, however, the appellant would like to explicitly point out again, that every individual who has received torture-based MK Ultra programming has life-long scars &#8211; here especially coccyx/pelvis, brain stem, teeth/tooth root canal/palate, eyes, ears, soles of the feet, inner genitals, (missing) glands &#8211; which can be proven life-long by MRI/CT/nuclear medical examinations. Therefore, the scientific statements of the appellant, scientist, and mother of the child, Mag. Riegler Andrea, are entirely provable, unfortunately not a conspiracy theory of a lunatic.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><u>To end this appeal for investigation, the appellant would like to quote again Alison Miller, in her article out of the book </u>&#8220;From the Trenches. A victim and therapist talk about mind control and ritual abuse&#8221; by Wendy Hoffman, Alison Miller (2018, Karnac)</span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-size: 13px;">&#8220;Things I wish I did not know</span></em><br />
<span style="font-size: 13px;"><em>Have you ever wondered why mind control and ritual abuse survivors all over the world report the same phenomena? (&#8230;) Because perpetrator groups collaborate and teach one another techniques of torturing children, splitting the infant mind, and training mind-controlled victims. It is organized crime. It is psychologically sophisticated organized crime. What else should we call it? Like the Mafia, it runs in families; (&#8230;) I did not realize the extent of the national and international organization of these groups. (&#8230;) I wish I had not learned that politicians are involved, including the world leaders. I wish I had not learned that some of my favorite musicians and film stars may have been involved, that the groups have a hand in deciding who rises to stardom. I wish I had not learned recently that some people who purport to help survivors, including some well-known therapists, religious leaders, and leaders of non-profit groups, are actually members of perpetrator groups with jobs such as spreading disinformation or gathering and silencing survivors who had escaped. I wish that Christianity and Judaism and perhaps other religions had not been corrupted and misused by perpetrators. I wish that various schools of therapy had not been corrupted and misused by perpetrators. I wish that therapists were not teaching self-help techniques which are actually program triggers (&#8230;) I wish I did not know all this.</em>&#8221; (Alison Miller, 2018)</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">Due to the lack of a lawyer since the beginning of the case in 2011ff the appellant, Mag.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">The appellant also points out that this appeal will be published on the network site traumabasedmindcontrol.com to avoid being killed before the Den Haag High Prosecution Court is able to answer, a well to provide other concerned protective parents with their beloved children some information.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> The term “strategically entanglement” is used to describe the modus operandi prevailing in intelligence agencies, to enable committing a severe crime (murder, torture, mutilations, arson, etc. most often with child victims), guaranteeing that no prosecution will follow, as well – by filming these crimes – to create official and unofficial personnel who will have to follow orders until the rest of their lives. This procedure is known to have started with the Nazis, after the war soon every single agency worldwide was following this strategy. Even before the Nazi era, such procedures were claimed over centuries with hundreds of testimonies, to be conducted either in Freemasonry as well in Satanic groups. In due course, these strategically entangled also do have to hand over their offspring for MK ultra programming.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2">[2]</a>/3 MK ultra was officially an US-American governmental project to create the “perfect soldier/spy/assassin”, the “Uebermensch” in the Nazi tradition etc. Due to this well-known project, the term is commonly used for trauma-based mind control procedures, conducted by governments themselves, while the term SRA, satanic or sadistic ritual abuse, is commonly used for Satanic or Masonic groups, using the same procedures as in the government projects. It is known, that there is an exchange between governmental groups and “satanic/masonic” groups, as well it is well proven that within MK ultra or trauma-based mind control also black magick/satanic elements are needed, therefore also the term “military SRA” was coined […]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><a href="#_ftnref4" name="_ftn4">[4]</a> In the Sadegh case this victim-perpetrator circle will become massive visible during the whole case, as many former victims, have been acting as perpetrators as adults. Many of them are even linked to (supra)national agencies, the most horrific example is that of the perpetrator Mag. Lauppert-Scholz, Kathrin Ruth (*born 1972), whose father, later Dr. Scholz Anthony, was one of the toddlers landing at Liverpool train station (Jewish children trains flying the Nazis without their parents), who then were MK-ed in Britain by British government, to later go on torture-based programming their own children, so his daughter, Mag. Lauppert-Scholz, Kathrin Ruth. She then took care, that also her own children underwent MK ultra. In due course, she and her husband, Mag. Lauppert Egon, were recognized as two of the main perpetrators during the torture crimes of Sadegh, Dara Rubens, since age 2. As this family does have double nationalities (Austrian and British) this might be the reason why the appellant was targeted so intensively by British agencies. It can be assumed that Sadegh, Dara Rubens is being or will be targeted by British services as well.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><a href="#_ftnref5" name="_ftn5">[5]</a> Even Russian president Vladimir Putin was warning that Russia would be able to create “super soldiers” with no mercy, feeling no pain, more terrifying than an atomic bomb. See: <a href="https://youtu.be/9v3TNGmbArs">https://youtu.be/9v3TNGmbArs</a>, not to mention the loads of scientific literature on this subject.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><a href="#_ftnref6" name="_ftn6">[6]</a> If the High Prosecution Office in Den Haag would consider to open a bureau for MK ultra and SRA cases worldwide, there would be thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of cases handed in within a few months from all over the world.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><a href="#_ftnref7" name="_ftn7">[7]</a> Most of the cases are <strong>voluntarily</strong>, meaning, the parents and/or caregivers are forced or MK-ed to handing over their offspring for torture-based mind control programming, some even before birth […] In Austria as well in the US it is well known, that intelligence agencies are luring the (future) parents into contracts for their children, guaranteeing them, a stellar career in military, judiciary, authorities, etc.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><a href="#_ftnref8" name="_ftn8">[8]</a> Intergenerational abuse subsumes the fact, that these torture-based mind control programming techniques are handed over from one generation to the next, by torturing their own offspring, to train them, to do so as well with their own offspring later on. Sometimes for programming as well for security reasons, there is a massive exchange of babies, especially within masonic and satanic groups, meaning the babies are transferred from one family into the next, never knowing their biological parents later on, as well the well-known procedure of creating cuckoo children, which on one hand is done for test of courage, demonstration of power within merely freemasonic groups as well for “black magick”/satanic goals.

<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><a href="#_ftnref21" name="_ftn21">[21]</a> See full list of recognized/named perpetrators by the young Sadegh, Dara Rubens in 2011/2012, also in the appendix</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><a href="#_ftnref22" name="_ftn22">[22]</a> The named perpetrators recognized by the child are out of health care, physicians, psychologists, therapists, media, secret service with wide and broad connections to Austrian politics, military, ministry of justice, ministry of interior affairs, also well connected to German as well as US-American and British intelligence agencies and universities and have been reported several times since 2011ff. The name list will get described in full detail in a further chapter.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><a href="#_ftnref23" name="_ftn23">[23]</a> Secret Service officials from Austria, as well numerous intel officials of international agencies are known to the appellant by name and can get fully investigated anytime and will be listed in a separate file in the Appendix. Intelligence officers, that pretend to be civilians, are difficult to spot at first glance. Therefore, the list must be considered as “work in progress”. Also, to mention here, many of the perpetrators recognized by the young Sadegh Dara Rubens, got (in)formal jobs within Austrian intelligence to protect them from prosecution or have been intelligence officials, veiled as civilians even long before the child was even born.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><a href="#_ftnref24" name="_ftn24">[24]</a> Deliberate electroshocks, poisons, unknown military weapons based on microwave and laser-technologies, etc. have been causing severe neurological damages and injuries, which led to the early pension of the appellant, Riegler Mag. Andrea, so far with beginning of January 2019. Due to ongoing assassinations, the neurological injuries are not able to heal, the appellant is and has been losing a lot of income, which according to her several educations and professional experience should be around at least 90k Euro net a year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><a href="#_ftnref25" name="_ftn25">[25]</a> Here it is necessary to stress, that the appellant and mother of the massively injured child, Sadegh Dara Rubens did not know anything about MK ultra or SRA related crimes in 2011f, but realized immediately because of this group of perpetrators, the young Sadegh Dara Rubens was able to name, that something extremely planned and deliberately caused must have happened: Nearly all of the above mentioned perpetrators do have excellent educations as well nearly all of them are in general highly intelligent. Also, this observation was reported to courts in grand detail, resulting in massive attacks from secret services, starting in 2011, when the young Sadegh, Dara Rubens was still living with his protective mother, the appellant, Mag. Riegler Andrea. Also, because of the massive fear of Sadegh, Dara Rubens it has been clear – even without scientific literature that this group ongoingly will repeat the torture on the child to intimidate and silence him. Also as stated by the child, as well by whistleblower Gudrun Hohenberger-Zwettler, there were many more perpetrators present, seemingly former partners of Mag. Riegler Andrea, therefore the list of perpetrators is far not complete, as due to the shock and panic states of the child, the appellant and mother of the child took (unfortunately) care not to overwhelm the beloved child with more pictures of possible perpetrators. The appellant found about the existence of MK ultra and SRA in late October 2012.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><a href="#_ftnref26" name="_ftn26">[26]</a> Also, the appellant Mag. Riegler Andrea wants to state here, that knowing that these perpetrator networks are ongoingly torturing her beloved son, it is extremely challenging to describe the torture-happenings in 2011ff in more details. All known happenings were reported in detail to Austrian courts and can get fully translated (where, when, how, who).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><a href="#_ftnref27" name="_ftn27">[27]</a> Every individual who has received torture-based MK Ultra programming has life-long scars &#8211; here especially coccyx/pelvis, brain stem, teeth/tooth root canal/palate, eyes, ears, soles of the feet, inner genitals, (missing) glands &#8211; which can be proven life-long by MRI/CT/nuclear medical examinations. Therefore, the scientific statements of the appellant, scientist and mother of the child, Mag. Riegler Andrea, are entirely provable, unfortunately not a conspiracy theory of a lunatic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><a href="#_ftnref28" name="_ftn28">[28]</a> As research results like the above led to severe attacks and murder attempts against the appellant Mag. Riegler Andrea, from multiple (supra)national agencies, she is – without protection within a crown witness program not able to do more and in-depth research at the moment.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><a href="#_ftnref29" name="_ftn29">[29]</a> &#8220;Grandma and Grandpa&#8221; Bretterklieber are Walter and Marianne Bretterklieber, both participated in the basic mind fracture torture of the toddler Sadegh Dara Rubens in 2011 and were reported as perpetrators at the Vienna Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office in 2011, together with other official family members such as Ing. (HTL) Riegler Helmut Valentin and Riegler Nicole as well their son Riegler Sebastian. Since January 2019, an application for a review of the actual family circumstances concerning DNA-tests has been submitted to the Graz Ost District Court, as Marianne Bretterklieber (previously Riegler, official birth name Karrer) is not the biological mother of Riegler Andrea, a procedure which is common practice in MK ultra and SRA cases, well described in international scientific literature. Marianne Bretterklieber, together with her brother Karrer Hans, obviously originates from a post-war Nazi Lebensborn e.V. institution, with extreme similarity to Jutta Horn (the later wife of the National Socialist Chief of Miracle Weapons, Hans Kammler, née 1901 in Stettin/Germany, now Poland) as, now as far as her brother Hans Karrer is concerned, with Otto Skorzeny (born 1908 in Vienna). Both siblings are thus of unclear &#8211; National Socialist &#8211; origin, both deeply involved in child trafficking rings including torture/drill and keeping (small) children ready for child trafficking networks. All that is known about Bretterklieber Marianne’s second husband, Bretterklieber Walter, is that he had to grow up without his mother, abandoned by his father, which led to massive disturbances and to an extreme proclivity for using violence against his entire family. As this violence was last known to Sadegh Dara Rubens, it can be assumed that there will be further victims.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><a href="#_ftnref30" name="_ftn30">[30]</a> Teeth, tooth root, gums stand for the warning to remain silent in these satanic ritual perpetrator networks, as well as in MK Ultra networks. The child Sadegh Dara Rubens was obviously &#8220;punished&#8221; here for naming perpetrators &#8211; in specialist literature, children who name perpetrators and networks of perpetrators are called &#8220;martyr children&#8221; because they are severely punished for failing to obey the order of silence. It is known that such torture scenes are recorded on video and are presented to others for intimidation, and these &#8220;punishments&#8221; go as far as further partial amputations of the victims&#8217; limbs, which slowly and painfully lead to death. (compare e.g. SNUFF films). Further mutilations of the child Sadegh Dara Rubens are to be foreseen, therefore as of 2011ff danger has been imminent, as the beloved child could be murdered, or triggered to commit suicide, in order to cover traces of the partly top-class perpetrators.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><a href="#_ftnref31" name="_ftn31">[31]</a> After a complaint to the district court BG Graz Ost, the YouTube channel was deleted a few days later, but has been copied several times as evidence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><a href="#_ftnref32" name="_ftn32">[32]</a> The researcher´s tragedy is, that the whole picture is not visible at first glance in detail. Several “puzzle pieces” of this huge case are revealing themselves up to now and are by far not fully revealed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><a href="#_ftnref33" name="_ftn33">[33]</a> The Istanbul Protocol was published in 2004 and it should be shortly stated, that the technologies for profound forensically examinations improved rapidly over the last – actually 2 decades – and all injuries, scars, etc. can get proven without exception over MRT/CT/nuclear medical scan in not even one hour.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><a href="#_ftnref34" name="_ftn34">[34]</a> The appellant would like to stress here, that as a researcher on her own, she is always behind the provable facts, which to find out would actually be the task of police officers, criminologists and prosecution officers: Her research, therefore, is an ongoing work in progress, especially without interrogations of the perpetrators, their connections, their official and unofficial employees, etc.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><a href="#_ftnref35" name="_ftn35">[35]</a> The Epstein case is highly connected to the Sadegh case, in terms of the whole modus operandi: Female breeding programs, genetic research, SRA, MK ultra, veiled as a private spleen of a Jewish billionaire, conducted on a remote island, etc. – here just to state, that there are several “Jeffrey Epsteins” placed all over the whole world to strategically entangle any local elite.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><a href="#_ftnref36" name="_ftn36">[36]</a> Without any investigation of the perpetrators, especially the physicians – Scheer, Dr. Prof Peter and Dunitz-Scheer, Dr. Prof. Marguerite who both prevented a detail examination of the young Sadegh Dara Rubens in 2011/2011 but threatened the appellant – every single court was overtaking the writing of the powerful “deep state” law company Lansky 1:1, even forgetting the academic title of the appellant, which is extremely uncommon in Austria, and depicts – with or without academic title – that the deep state here is ordering what is done from Austrian judiciary.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><a href="#_ftnref37" name="_ftn37">[37]</a> The director of the Institute Kutschera, Dr. Kutschera Gundl, was recognized by American and German adults affected by MK Ultra and between the ages of 2 ½ (Sadegh Dara Rubens) and 70 as a &#8220;MK Ultra trainer&#8221; &#8211; perpetrator. The connections of this family clan are extensive, primarily due to the project &#8220;Paperclip&#8221;, in which former high-ranking National Socialists were able to emigrate to America via the &#8220;rat line&#8221; after the war, to pursue their criminal &#8211; above all, corrosive &#8211; operations without interruption. Dr. Kutschera Gundl is also in contact with private American &#8220;mercenary companies&#8221; and there is an international exchange in the matter of &#8220;super soldiers&#8221;, as &#8220;fully programmed MK Ultra slaves&#8221; are referred to as adults. All her three now grown up children are under total MK Ultra programming, as perpetrators.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><a href="#_ftnref38" name="_ftn38">[38]</a> Here it is necessary to state shortly, that psychiatrist Elisabeth Lenzinger is without any doubt highly intelligent. To create the psychiatrically expert opinion in such a horrible quality, shows the Austrian strategy of pretending to be „stupid“- and this strategy of „pretending to be stupid“ is ongoingly staged by Austrian´s courts as well by the district court BG Innere Stadt.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><a href="#_ftnref39" name="_ftn39">[39]</a> Dr. Elisabeth Lenzinger declared Mag. Riegler Andrea as completely lunatic paranoid schizophrenic, ignoring all the evidence the appellant was providing already since 2011ff, ignoring that the appellant was working as a social counselor for the ministry of labor even after the child was “taken”. The expert opinion nevertheless, more important for other victims of this psychiatrist, was trying to trigger suicide. It is highly recommended to investigate suicides after expert opinions in Austria in general, as well in governmental child abduction cases.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><a href="#_ftnref40" name="_ftn40">[40]</a> A complaint against this severely MK-ed psychiatrist, Georg Pakesch, linked to Austrian secret service, which followed a suggestion to have his children examined over MRT/CT/nuclear medical examination as they are surely victims as well, was answered with a murder assassination in March 2016, after which the appellant had to leave Austria for several months, actually lost her whole existence, besides massive health problems.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><a href="#_ftnref41" name="_ftn41">[41]</a> Some prosecution officers, like Fauler, Dr. Rudolf from Graz prosecution office (10St210/15b) even mocked about the happenings in written, reacting to the child´s suffering concerning “waterboarding” – an international well-known form of white torture – suggesting this would concern “civil law in water right”. Officially of course, most probably an “erratum” of the brave intense working prosecution officials but more obvious – as most of the papers – a huge shock in terms of the brutality and cruelty of the Austrian judiciary towards a highly intelligent and beloved toddler/child, the appellant´s MK-ed son Sadegh, Dara Rubens.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><a href="#_ftnref42" name="_ftn42">[42]</a> The child psychologist at the Youth Welfare Department (CPS), Wonisch-Scheider Mag. Petra even was mocking in writing about the child´s severe flashbacks when having bowl movements, which reminded him often to the anal rapes and torture crimes, and stated in written, that the child would have problems due to a strict code of behavior demanded from the appellant, his mother, during bowl movements.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><a href="#_ftnref43" name="_ftn43">[43]</a> As self-explanatory, the bold numbers are the years, when the respective case started. Some of the cases are ongoing up to present, some do have files up to 1000+ within one case.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><a href="#_ftnref44" name="_ftn44">[44]</a> In the primary school (2015-2019) attended by the child Sadegh Dara Rubens in Hausmannstätten near Graz, a classic MK Ultra school, several children were suffering from (satanic/sadistic) ritual abuse and MK Ultra. The teacher of the child Sadegh Dara Rubens’s class, Mrs. Jutta Matzi, seemed to be handling several MK Ultra children by means of triggers and technical equipment, for further programming on official trips, etc. More details cannot be determined with certainty despite extensive photo and video material, and need a check of police units. The pediatrician of the child Sadegh Dara Rubens, lecturer. Dr. Zotter Heinz from Graz, is closely acquainted with the perpetrator circles: at least, with Dr. Kutschera Jörg (the son of Dr. Kutschera Gundl), whom he recommended as a substitute physician on his pediatrician’s website in 2018/2019. More important, Dr. Zotter Heinz is working as a sleep researcher at the university clinic in Graz, which means he is a MK Ultra programmer with the special field of &#8220;psychic driving&#8221;, a programming method popular and appreciated in Austria: The concerned children are kept in a kind of deep sleep for days, drugs are sometimes administered, while &#8211; depending on the programming of the personality parts &#8211; affirmations, etc. are played into their subconscious minds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><a href="#_ftnref45" name="_ftn45">[45]</a> Here it is important to note in the footnote that intelligent women who are or have been in an MK Ultra program are extremely often &#8211; mostly almost always &#8211; used as breeders:  In addition to pregnancies in childhood, usually from the age of 8 onwards, the &#8220;6-week pregnancies&#8221; are also known.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><a href="#_ftnref46" name="_ftn46">[46]</a> According to governmental insurance files, the entries have been faked in terms of the appellant, Riegler Mag. Andrea: Instead of receiving antibiotics in 2010 it was written down, that the appellant has been there because of a beginning mental illness since 2010. Complaints and reports to courts in 2012/2013 (as soon as the appellant found out about it) were never answered. Since then, the appellant Riegler Mag. Andrea does not dare to go to any physicians, merely just in case of emergencies, practically she is deprived of health care, for which she has been paying for years, as every single visit with a physician, even for a flu, could trigger a next row of violence against the appellant, un-covering the participation of Austrian physicians within the MK ultra-agenda. The appellant therefore specialized even more on alternative medicine, which has to get paid privately, therefore is much more expensive.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><a href="#_ftnref47" name="_ftn47">[47]</a> Threatened the appellant several times. Is acquainted with several perpetrators, involved physicians, judges, intel officials, etc.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><a href="#_ftnref48" name="_ftn48">[48]</a> Was present at the opening of the new child protection center Graz in 2012/2013 with the cover-up agents Sollhart, Mag. Roberta, Drees, Mag. Renate, Walisch, Gabriella. Pictures from mainstream media “Kleine Zeitung”.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><a href="#_ftnref49" name="_ftn49">[49]</a> Stepan, Dr. Alexandra´s short expert opinion was changed and these changes were reported to courts. Nevertheless, she did not see any psychiatric illness on the appellant, Riegler Mag., Andrea.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><a href="#_ftnref50" name="_ftn50">[50]</a> Prehsfreund, Dr. Olga later was seen online to be a representative physician for Kutschera, Dr. Jörg (see Kutschera, Dr. Gundl) as well for the child physician from Sadegh Dara from 2015ff, Zotter, Dr. Heinz, who is a specialist on “sleep”-research at the Klinikum Graz. Sleep researchers are often MK ultra-programmers, specialized on psychic driving.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><a href="#_ftnref51" name="_ftn51">[51]</a> This from Tepper, Univ. Prof. Dr. Gabor, veiled as “Oka” according to the minor. Both the appellant and the child were thrown out of this dental clinic, the dental specialists refused to have the teeth x-rayed. The most shocking thing, actually has been and still is, that the specialized dentists are very well aware of this kind of injuries, caused with needles, pricking the tooth root canals or the palate.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><a href="#_ftnref52" name="_ftn52">[52]</a> Dr. Lenzinger, Elisabeth is privately acquainted with perpetrators recognized in the Sadegh case as well with district judge Kubiczek, MMag. Konrad and tried to place suicide triggers within her written expert opinion about the appellant, Riegler Mag., Andrea. If Den Haag would consider to investigate, it is recommended to clarify, how many court ordered expert opinions of this psychiatric expert were driving its victims into committing suicide: Together with “Zersetzung” of the Austrian intelligence agencies, as well the suffering of the beloved child/ren it is for a “normal” protective parent unbearable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><a href="#_ftnref53" name="_ftn53">[53]</a> Besides the appellant worked full time as a social counsellor in 2013 as well she was able to proof everything she was talking about, backed-up even with scientific literature, he ignored her writings, therefore, she was diagnosed by him as “logically delusional”, which is not a legally valid diagnosis. He is connected to Austrian secret service/MK ultra and also was eager to hear every single detail of the torture crimes, Sadegh Dara Rubens had to endure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><a href="#_ftnref54" name="_ftn54">[54]</a> Sleep researchers are often MK ultra-programmers, specialized on psychic driving.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><a href="#_ftnref55" name="_ftn55">[55]</a> To protect whistleblowers, the appellant can hand in to Den Haag´s court more detailed information after the case has been accepted.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><a href="#_ftnref56" name="_ftn56">[56]</a> The parents of more than 2.000 toddlers were forced into gag-orders by the Austrian Socialist Party (SPÖ) as well by a “child protection center”, named “Weißer Ring”: According to several whistleblowers the parents of the tortured children got 5.000,- Euro each for their silence about what was committed against their children, otherwise, they were threatened to lose their children over governmental youth welfare departments/child snatching.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><a href="#_ftnref57" name="_ftn57">[57]</a> Within the Ibiza Affair, Vice Chancellor Strache Heinz-Christian was stating in front of a hidden camera, that one of the former leaders of the Austrian Socialist Party – Kern Christian – would have tortured black babies and toddlers in “cape town” – the double meaning of “Cape Town” as a city as well as a code for “rituals, where hooded capes” are worn are obvious. The whole scandal was silenced after the dissolution of the government.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><a href="#_ftnref58" name="_ftn58">[58]</a> It is known that many Austrian and German protective parents were killing themselves after their child/ren have been taken by Austrian government.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><a href="#_ftnref59" name="_ftn59">[59]</a> There were many occasions since 2011ff where this strategy became visible, and can get explained in all details, after accepting the case for investigation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><a href="#_ftnref60" name="_ftn60">[60]</a> Severely mentally ill persons, who lost their children because of their mental illness, are able to pay alimony in Austria, and describes the bias of the Austrian judiciary, which is implemented to destroy protective parents on any level imaginable, physically, mentally, socially, financially, existentially. The appellant is refusing officially to pay alimony, before her beloved son gets finally examined, therefore is sued from the Austrian Youth Welfare Department/CPS.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><a href="#_ftnref61" name="_ftn61">[61]</a> Latest torture events of Sadegh Dara Rubens have been taken place during the festive days 2020, according to pictures from his soccer club, his health state is deteriorating massively, this January 2020.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><a href="#_ftnref62" name="_ftn62">[62]</a> Here the appellant just wants to state shortly, that the Nazi era was well prepared by taking out political opponents as well their beloved children, long before Jewish and gypsy citizens were systematically deported and killed. It is also sadly known, that the first Jewish citizen, reporting in foreign countries about the horrors of the concentration camps were not believed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><a href="#_ftnref63" name="_ftn63">[63]</a> List of lawyers who handed in completely different things than agreed upon in written and never were brought to court for these crimes, see list in the appendix.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><a href="#_ftnref64" name="_ftn64">[64]</a> As self-explanatory, the bold numbers are the years, when the respective case started. Some of the cases are ongoing up to present, some do have files up to 1000+ within one case.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><a href="#_ftnref65" name="_ftn65">[65]</a> According to governmental insurance files, the entries have been faked in terms of the appellant, Riegler Mag. Andrea: Instead of receiving antibiotics in 2010 it was written down, that the appellant has been there because of a beginning mental illness since 2010. Complaints and reports to courts in 2012/2013 (as soon as the appellant found out about it) were never answered. Since then, the appellant Riegler Mag. Andrea does not dare to go to any physicians, merely just in case of emergencies, practically she is deprived of health care, for which she has been paying for years, as every single visit with a physician, even for a flu, could trigger a next row of violence against the appellant, un-covering the participation of Austrian physicians within the MK ultra-agenda. The appellant therefore specialized even more on alternative medicine, which has to get paid privately, therefore is much more expensive.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><a href="#_ftnref66" name="_ftn66">[66]</a> Threatened the appellant several times. Is acquainted with several perpetrators, involved physicians, judges, intel officials, etc.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><a href="#_ftnref67" name="_ftn67">[67]</a> Was present at the opening of the new child protection center Graz in 2012/2013 with the cover-up agents Sollhart, Mag. Roberta, Drees, Mag. Renate, Walisch, Gabriella. Pictures from mainstream media “Kleine Zeitung”.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><a href="#_ftnref68" name="_ftn68">[68]</a> Stepan, Dr. Alexandra´s short expert opinion was changed and these changes were reported to courts. Nevertheless, she did not see any psychiatric illness on the appellant, Riegler Mag., Andrea.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><a href="#_ftnref69" name="_ftn69">[69]</a> Prehsfreund, Dr. Olga later was seen online to be a representative physician for Kutschera, Dr. Jörg (see Kutschera, Dr. Gundl) as well for the child physician from Sadegh Dara from 2015ff, Zotter, Dr. Heinz, who is a specialist on “sleep”-research at the Klinikum Graz. Sleep researchers are often MK ultra-programmers, specialized on psychic driving.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><a href="#_ftnref70" name="_ftn70">[70]</a> This from Tepper, Univ. Prof. Dr. Gabor, veiled as “Oka” according to the minor. Both the appellant and the child were thrown out of this dental clinic, the dental specialists refused to have the teeth x-rayed. The most shocking thing, actually has been and still is, that the specialized dentists are very well aware of this kind of injuries, caused with needles, pricking the tooth root canals or the palate.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><a href="#_ftnref71" name="_ftn71">[71]</a> Dr. Lenzinger, Elisabeth is privately acquainted with perpetrators recognized in the Sadegh case as well with district judge Kubiczek, MMag. Konrad and tried to place suicide triggers within her written expert opinion about the appellant, Riegler Mag., Andrea. If Den Haag would consider to investigate, it is recommended to clarify, how many court ordered expert opinions of this psychiatric expert were driving its victims into committing suicide: Together with “Zersetzung” of the Austrian intelligence agencies, as well the suffering of the beloved child/ren it is for a “normal” protective parent unbearable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><a href="#_ftnref72" name="_ftn72">[72]</a> Besides the appellant worked full time as a social counsellor in 2013 as well she was able to proof everything she was talking about, backed-up even with scientific literature, he ignored her writings, therefore, she was diagnosed by him as “logically delusional”, which is not a legally valid diagnosis. He is connected to Austrian secret service/MK ultra and also was eager to hear every single detail of the torture crimes, Sadegh Dara Rubens had to endure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><a href="#_ftnref73" name="_ftn73">[73]</a> Sleep researchers are often MK ultra-programmers, specialized on psychic driving.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><a href="#_ftnref74" name="_ftn74">[74]</a> Here it is necessary to stress, that the appellant and mother of the massively injured child, Sadegh Dara Rubens did not know anything about MK ultra or SRA related crimes in 2011f, but realized immediately because of this group of perpetrators, the young Sadegh Dara Rubens was able to name, that something extremely planned and deliberately caused must have happened: Nearly all of the above mentioned perpetrators do have excellent educations as well nearly all of them are in general highly intelligent. Also, this observation was reported to courts in grand detail, resulting in massive attacks from secret services, starting in 2011, when the young Sadegh, Dara Rubens was still living with his protective mother, the appellant, Mag. Riegler Andrea. Also, because of the massive fear of Sadegh, Dara Rubens it has been clear – even without scientific literature that this group ongoingly will repeat the torture on the child to intimidate and silence him. Also as stated by the child, as well by whistleblower Gudrun Hohenberger-Zwettler, there were many more perpetrators present, seemingly former partners of Mag. Riegler Andrea, therefore the list of perpetrators is far not complete, as due to the shock and panic states of the child, the appellant and mother of the child took (unfortunately) care not to overwhelm the beloved child with more pictures of possible perpetrators. The appellant found about the existence of MK ultra and SRA in late October 2012.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><a href="#_ftnref75" name="_ftn75">[75]</a> Also, the appellant Mag. Riegler Andrea wants to state here, that knowing that these perpetrator networks are ongoingly torturing her beloved son, it is extremely challenging to describe the torture-happenings in 2011ff in more details. All known happenings were reported in detail to Austrian courts and can get fully translated (where, when, how, who).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><a href="#_ftnref76" name="_ftn76">[76]</a> Every individual who has received torture-based MK Ultra programming has life-long scars &#8211; here especially coccyx/pelvis, brain stem, teeth/tooth root canal/palate, eyes, ears, soles of the feet, inner genitals, (missing) glands &#8211; which can be proven life-long by MRI/CT/nuclear medical examinations. Therefore, the scientific statements of the appellant, scientist and mother of the child, Mag. Riegler Andrea, are entirely provable, unfortunately not a conspiracy theory of a lunatic.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SHORT SUMMARY:</p>
<p>While the appellant, Mag. Riegler Andrea is ongoingly threatened to be placed under lunacy – merely because of asking what happened to the teeth of the child in January 2019, the head of the youth welfare department Graz/Styria (CPS) is officially stating, that the child <u>would not have lost his adult teeth</u>:</p>
<p><u>The pictures indicate clearly that the child partly has artificial dental crowns (January 2019), then artificial teeth (October 2019), then seemingly no teeth (January 2020), to end again with different artificial teeth (March 2020).</u></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As stated in the appellants appeal, the loss of teeth can happen either during torture deliberately (punishment, to set an example, torture porn, snuff) as well as unintentionally, if the electroshocks during re-/de-programming are overdone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even more alarming, is the fact that the general health state of the child, Sadegh Dara Rubens is more and more deteriorating (massively), experts on MK ultra/SRA/SSP are considering the possibility that the child has been placed into an open MK ultra <u>torture-research program</u> in the meantime: the teeth are just one part of his chronic injuries/ mutilations that have happened since 2011ff.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>NOTE: Children in MK ultra programs as well in SRA/trafficking programs cannot be spotted at first glance, as these children are trained from early childhood on to not let anyone know. Therefore, the portrait pictures of Sadegh Dare look “normal” to laymen, over the years the appellant collected many more pictures and films, where the shocked, traumatized Sadegh Dara Rubens is very well visible.</u></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>EXCURSUS:</p>
<p>The writing of the Youth Welfare Department is a result of an official inquiry of the appellant about the health state of the child Sadegh Dara Rubens. The inquiry – which got “answered” for the first time after years – can be handed over to DEN HAAG, if the court considers them as interesting.</p>
<p>Most importantly the writing states, that the child would not have lost his teeth, as well, that the child would not have been examined via MRT/CT/nuclear medical examination as</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3789" src="https://traumabasedmindcontrol.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/webseitenoexaminations.gif" alt="" width="685" height="29" /></p>
<p><em>“These examinations were not necessary and were therefore not carried out.”</em></p>
<p>Source: E-Mail, 15<sup>th</sup> of June 2020: Youth Welfare Department (CPS)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The reason for this is according to the CPS that</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3790" src="https://traumabasedmindcontrol.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/webseiteenhusiastic.gif" alt="" width="1089" height="34" /></p>
<p><em>“Dara plays enthusiastically football in the club Hausmannstätten and does a lot of other sports, there are no chronic injuries.”, </em></p>
<p>ignoring that even with injuries on the tailbone/pelvis children can do “static” sports (football, jogging, skiing, swimming) but not sports where the tailbone/pelvis is challenged (gymnastics, yoga, etc.) – ignoring the fact, that if untreated, the chronic injuries can even lead into invalidity as adults, as the injured pelvis could irreversible damage the spine, as it is common on Austrian victims of SRA/MK ultra. (…)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The other contradictions of CPS can be handed over in full translation, if regarded as important. Here merely the torture-based injuries of Sadegh Dara Rubens are mentioned and quoted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because of technical reasons, the appellant will send out this writing first without signatures (to enable an enlarged view of the pictoral material), as well in a signed form and will print out professional pictures within this/the next week and send them over post, to have this part of evidence in DEN HAAG.</p>

<p><u>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION/UPDATE:</u></p>
<p>The appellant, Riegler Andrea, wants to provide the Den Haag High Prosecution Officer with further – possible – evidence, about pictures of a “tortured/raped” boy around 9-10 years old, looking extremely similar to the appellant’s son, Sadegh Dara Rubens:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3813" src="https://traumabasedmindcontrol.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/boy_text_web.gif" alt="" width="846" height="960" /></p>

<p>(copied from Facebook, July 2020)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The picture is of a bad quality, and the boy is wearing make-up, but the eyes, the chin, the (inner) ears, the mouth are the same (&#8230;) Sadegh Dara Rubens has a birthmark, a little scratch on the top of his nose, exactly here the picture is &#8220;pixeled&#8217;, meaning not visible enough.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, the boy depicted does not have all his teeth any more – this suggests that the picture could have been taken during the removal of (parts) of the teeth of Sadegh Dara Rubens, as described in detail in the writings from February 2020 and June 2020.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Without being specialized on it, the nose of the depicted boy seems to be swollen, which would correspond to the assumption, that the tortured/sex-trafficked boy is Sadegh Dara Rubens.</p>
<p>The FBI is informed, as well Europol/Interpol, will be informed together with Austrian Supreme Court of Justice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Please note that child trafficking/human trafficking is a life-long “ingredient” in MK ultra (beta slave) programming: Especially children, but also adults are trafficked their whole life to ensure, they stay “programmed” as well to “monetize” the “MK ultra slaves”, most often for governmental black budgets.</u></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Mag. Riegler Andrea</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Attachment(s):</u></p>
<p>These pictures will be sent to the Den Haag prosecution officer also via post.</p>

Pictorial evidence of the loss of all his adult teeth before the age of 10, as well as of severe SNUFF torture (obviously my son was put on a respiratory machine after his &#8211; adult &#8211; teeth were taken out to be able to sexual abuse him orally without interruption) is no reason for these courts to interfere. The pictorial evidence is manipulated, stressing the fact that it is about to “teach a lesson”: When overexposing the picture, one can see that within the mouth of my son a next picture is inserted, showing a classroom with a teacher (!). The message is clear, sadly also from International Courts: Those who speak out, those who expose governmental MK ultra networks with its MK-ed judges, authority officials, and intelligence employees will get punished even more – this on the back of their beloved children. The psychopathy within these (court?) procedures proves my researches sadly even more right, as no human judge would allow this to happen on the back of a beloved and highly talented child, this ongoingly since 2012.</span></div>

<p align="right"><span style="font-family: 'Libre Franklin',sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"><strong><span lang="EN-US">MMag. Konrad Kubiczek, Viennese family judge in the Sadegh case </span></strong></span><span style="font-family: 'Libre Franklin',sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"><strong><span lang="EN-US">concerning the horrific flashbacks of Luki Dara Sadegh, then 2 ½ years old, </span></strong></span><span style="font-family: 'Libre Franklin',sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"><strong><span lang="EN-US">despite of having scientific literature on SRA mind control on his desk</span></strong></span></p>
<p align="right"><span style="font-family: 'Libre Franklin',sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">Satanic holidays have been mentioned in scientific literature on satanic ritual abuse or trauma based mind control [1] on one hand because of the confessions of victims, and on the other hand because of the registered crimes (abductions, rapes, mutilations of children) around these “festive” dates, meaning ritual abuse (physical, psychological and spiritual abuse).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">Satanists are obsessed with rituals, symbols, numerology, and so these festive days overlap with the dates of all religions, which is one of the most important satanic/psychopathic characteristics, besides infiltration and silence, betrayal and deception. While holding solid, “respectable” jobs and attending their – official – churches, they celebrate their own “festive days” right afterwards.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">he holidays, as well as the &#8220;language&#8221; of the respective calendars, is &#8220;old&#8221; and again underlines the centuries-old tradition of celebrating these festivals, together with bestial child sacrifices. The perpetrators, one remembers XAVAS and several other artists, do not usually dress up in devil’s </span>horns,<span style="font-size: 13px;"> but are &#8220;in suit and robe&#8221; – that is, in highly respectable, bourgeois professions. These calendars also show how obsessed many Satanists appear to be with &#8220;sexuality&#8221;, preferably S / M &#8211; BDSM [2], as well as with body fluids (blood, semen, urine), as described in detail in the scientific literature on ritual abuse or artistically processed by artists such as Kim Noble, herself a </span>trauma based<span style="font-size: 13px;"> mind control and ritual abuse victim. In his novel &#8220;eleven minutes&#8221;, the life-story of the Brazilian prostitute Maria, famous writer Paolo Coelho also outlines not only BDSM, but also reveals details of &#8220;holy prostitution / sacrifice&#8221;: power &#8211; powerlessness, sadomasochism (submission, subjugation), tormenting and killing &#8220;those unworthy of life&#8221;, especially &#8220;guilt-transference rituals&#8221;, as secret initiation rituals seem to be the main attraction for these groups. Due to the bestial crimes against children, in particular, one can imagine how many perpetrators want to break out of this vicious circle, as documented in the literature, but cannot, since they are caught on photos and video recordings and are therefore in the hands of the Satanists / psychopaths, and thus tend to conduct these festive days &#8220;in a spiritual manner&#8221; and try to seduce others to join.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Libre Franklin',sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">Subsequently, one can observe the machismo of these networks, in which again only the proven stereotypes of femininity are allowed (witch-whore-saints), the feminine element is to be destroyed or suppressed, and also the obsession of Satanists / psychopaths with &#8220;interbreeding&#8221;, so that inter-generational &#8220;dynasties&#8221; are sometimes built in secret, in which women are used only as &#8220;breeders&#8221;, and due to potentially hidden cases of paternity, more people are in turn blackmailable. Due to the &#8220;changing of children&#8221; often mentioned in scientific literature, and reported by all former Illuminati and Illuminati-related persons &#8211; especially Fritz Springmeier, John Todd or Svali &#8211; intergenerational breeding can be better understood: bonds of flesh and blood are thus subordinated to the &#8220;satanic&#8221; goals. The experience of heartbreak, if it remains unreflected upon and unhealed, makes it easier to dehumanize others, and therefore to torture or torment also small children and babies. Again, this brings to mind the words of English specialists in this field: &#8220;No one wants to know that it’s happening next door&#8221;, because that means it isn’t a crime perpetrated &#8220;somewhere&#8221; upon &#8220;poor orphans&#8221; in a &#8220;distant continent&#8221; by &#8220;primitive natives&#8221;, but right in our immediate neighborhood in our western world. The bestial atrocities that people can carry out against other people, especially to children, simply take one’s breath away: American psychologist Colin A. Ross also states in his book &#8220;Satanic Ritual Abuse&#8221; that this ritual abuse is the most horrific thing that can happen to a child, as the damage is irreversible, and also explains why these atrocities must be concealed and denied at all costs: victims must be &#8220;disposed of&#8221;, as well as witnesses &#8211; &#8220;death to traitors&#8221; is the top priority of such groups. Psychologist Ellen Lacter describes on her website http://endritualabuse.org/about/overview-of-the-differences-between-satanism-and-witchcraft/ the different types of abuse conducted by satanists a well as witches (satanism vs. witchcraft): I have not yet been able to find any (specialist) literature on how, above all, these oaths, vows, pledges and promises of guilt can be resolved; this knowledge seems to have disappeared. In my opinion, this knowledge of how to revoke this ritual transfer of guilt, vows and oaths is &#8220;the holy grail&#8221; in the field of &#8220;ritual abuse&#8221;, since satanists / psychopaths are evidently able to change karmic / spiritual laws through rituals, i.e. to offload their own burden onto others. Interestingly enough, most of the people who deal with the topic, from the high-level Illuminati to the hobby esotericist, are convinced that one must have earned his / her &#8220;karma&#8221; by choosing it for themselves in this lifetime: these arguments can be found on Satanic NWO-pages (argued by high-ranking Illuminati), and is also propagated in esoteric circles as well as in teaching institutions for coaching, training and counselling, and subsequently I was told quite often – even by perpetrators in the Sadegh case – that the crime against my son and also myself was therefore justified. Besides offering the chance to comfortably blame someone else, this also enables another goal to be achieved – namely, to obtain the &#8220;moral&#8221; legitimacy to dehumanize the victims (even more). Nevertheless:No one has the right or permission to torture (small) children. No child in the world, no matter what their colour, their nationality or belief system, deserves this suffering. No child in the world should be allowed to be used sexually, spiritually, mentally or physically. Every single child must be protected from such crimes.<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[May 22, 2019 &#8211; meditation for all toddlers and children in the 3rd REICH]</p>
<p>https://www.facebook.com/events/366825867261928/</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A short summary in terms of (un)known history: Babies, toddlers, and children in the 3th REICH</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Doing research over years – if not decades &#8211; on this topic, I found out (as far as possible), that we are told on children at least 2 big lies: On one hand the experimentation on Jewish toddlers and children were seemingly much worse than we are able to imagine &#8211; on the other hand, the total silence about the hundreds of thousands MK ultra programmed German toddlers and children, living in average families in the 3rd REICH and its occupied countries. [&#8230;] Without truth, there is no healing, so no wonder that there is still an invisible (programmed) war between at least these two groups, being directed by the same masters on the top into hatred, destruction, and anger for decades now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What groups of babies, toddlers and children were there in the 3rd REICH?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Group1: T4 – starting with 1933 babies, toddlers and children were fetched out of their families, partly they had some disabilities, but as nowadays they were taken away from their parents because of many reasons (political opponents, need of “material” for plain horrific research). Often the children of this group were completely healthy, and – just for crying for their beloved parents – declared severely insane/mentally ill. Officially all were insane and “had to get killed”- see “life unworthy of life” (“lebensunwertes Leben”). They were killed indeed, but before horrendous horrific research was done on them. (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_unworthy_of_life and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aktion_T4)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Group2: Jewish children. Also beginning with 1933 many Jews were leaving the German-speaking countries, bringing them into situations where – for sure – many Jewish children had to suffer from various reasons. Also known is that many children were transported to the UK without their parents (“Liverpool Station, London” – “children trains” &#8211; see http://talkingbeautifulstuff.com/2013/05/23/the-kindertransport-statue-liverpool-street-station-london/) – unknown is that many of them got MK ultra by the British government during their stay in England. Also known is that many of the Jewish families went to Israel/Haifa, where “Nakam” (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nakam) was located nearby. Many Jewish children underwent MK ultra there (see http://israelirealities.blogspot.com/2007/03/mk-ultra-israeli-project.html). Most commonly known is nevertheless the huge group in the concentration camps, where open horrific research was done on them. (see http://www.auschwitz.dk/Holocaust1.htm).There have been survivors speaking out about this, but many sources claim that the experimentations were even too much for the Nazi doctors, so they tried to get rid of all the evidence (see Dr. Vladimir Terziski https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEe-QGohonU). Besides breeding experiments, experimentation on souls, most probably time travel experiments we do not know much about the happenings there, so we just can guess, as every information seems to be censored at the moment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Group3: Also, other children were of interest of the brutally researching Nazi doctors in the concentration camps: Here mostly known are the toddlers and children out of Gypsy families as well those of small stature. (see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children_in_the_Holocaust)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Group4: The most forgotten group is – in my opinion &#8211; the hugest: Average German children and &#8220;germanised&#8221; children in the occupied countries, who underwent plain mk ultra and SRA, to create the Aryan master race, the superhuman being. All we know are Adolf Hitler´s intentions for “his” youth: “&#8221;A violent, bossy, fearless, cruel youth I want. They must endure pain. There must be nothing weak and tender about them &#8230; Strong and beautiful I want my youth. So, I can create the new. I do not want intellectual education. With knowledge, I spoil my youth. I would prefer to let them learn only what they voluntarily pick up following their play instinct. But they must learn control. They must learn to defeat the fear of death in the most difficult situations.&#8221; (Adolf Hitler, Chancellor of the REICH &#8211; see https://www.georg-elser-gedenkstaette.de/app/download/15983951696/04_Hitler+Jugenderziehung+2.pdf?t=1526724481). We also know for sure, that the Nazi MK programs, never stopped in the German-speaking countries: Programmers at least came back for having holidays with their families, ongoing torture-based programming their “superhuman being” (…).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Group5: All the occupied countries &#8211; &#8211; &#8211; Norway, Denmark, Sweden, Netherlands, France, (Austria), Belgium, Greece, Finland, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Yugoslavia, Luxembourg, parts of Russia (Galicia), Liechtenstein, Ukraine, North Africa, Portugal, Spain, Monaco – partly together with Italy &#8211; &#8211; &#8211; were targeting babies, toddlers and children – we know, that where the Nazi doctors were located during WW2, we do have ongoing MK hotspots even nowadays (“follow the traces of the Nazi doctors”). (see for example: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aribert_Heim or https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josef_Mengele#Military_service to give at least 2 examples – there were many more physicians involved).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Group6: About 250,000 German children were sent via trains to Denmark at the end of WW2 – instead of helping these toddlers and children, they were used as a kind of patsy, were abused as well as killed by Danish authorities. (see https://www.spiegel.de/international/denmark-s-myths-shattered-a-legacy-of-dead-german-children-a-355772.html)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Group7: Norwegian women with their babies, toddlers, and children fathered by German soldiers were thrown out of Norway after WW2, meaning they lost even their nationality. No one knows much about these babies, toddlers, and children sent into a – for them – foreign past WW2 Germany (see https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/19/world/europe/norway-lebensborn-german-girls.html)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Group8: Similar to Norway, we do have human hunts towards women (and their babies, toddlers, and children) who had German soldiers as partners, husbands or even as fathers of their children. A less painful reflection of these happenings is Giuseppe Tornatore´s “Malèna” https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mal%C3%A8na. (Other sources see: https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/jun/05/women-victims-d-day-landings-second-world-war and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_collaboration)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A short summary of the unwritten history:</p>
<p>All those open horrible experiments and killing (euthanasia) of these babies, toddlers, and children in the 3rd REICH, were seemingly a façade to hide even more brutal experiments and suffering of these small ones.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Considering the possibility of time travel, of age regression, of hybrid(breeding)experimentation, transhumanism and changes in epigenetics we are going to do the meditation for all the toddlers and children of the 3rd Reich no matter what religious beliefs their parents were having, no matter which ideologies were present in their former homes – to give them back the sovereignty of their souls as well their freedom, as much as possible.</p>

<p>Dan&amp;amp;Don: Hi guys, Wednesday night, I am Dan &#8211; I am Don &#8211; you are watching Reality Brief. We got a special guest tonight &#8211; Andrea. How are you doing tonight, Andrea?</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Andrea: I am fine so far, how are you?</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Dan&amp;amp;Don: Great. So, you talk to us from Austria, right?</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Andrea: Yes, Austria, Vienna.</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Dan&amp;amp;Don: Your specialty I guess you can call it would be trauma-based mind control &#8211; your website is on the screen &lt;a href=&#8221;http://www.traumabasedmindcontrol.com&#8221;&gt;www.traumabasedmindcontrol.com&lt;/a&gt;</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Andrea: Yes, I am specialised on the symptoms of the small and smallest ones, when all this mind fracture and basic programming is starting.</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Dan&amp;amp;Don: So, how did you get into this? Like, what was your circumstances finding out about all this stuff?</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Andrea: Well, I came into this topic over my son, when he was 2 1/2 years old. He, after actually not even half a year with visits at his daddy (on his own) and – had quite all of sudden horrible flashbacks telling me the most crazy, horrendous things you have ever heard. And within the flashbacks there was no doubt that he had suffered something severely, so I was trying to puzzle out what might have happened without knowing anything about satanic ritual abuse or MK ultra and &#8211; I started to write down line by line what he told me also describing his language, his body language, what triggered him, and so on&#8230; and, sent it to courts, and always asking to have him examined in detail over MRT/CT. Courts refused (to have him examined in detail) and &#8211; Austrian government took him then away. Now I know &#8211; because he recognized 72+ perpetrators involved in his basic mind fracture and also as his programmers or mk ultra trainers and, afterwards, they claimed &#8220;no, the boy would be healthy and would have nothing&#8221;. So, the blame was put on me as a kind of patsy or scapegoat and after that, they presented me under supervised visits my highly traumatized son very openly so, he actually is officially in a MK ultra program. With no chance to get help for him, with no chance to get any examinations. This is the status quo now since 2011, so he is ongoing in a program for 7 years now.</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Dan&amp;amp;Don: That´s heart-breaking &#8211; that´s heart-breaking and frightening that they just can do this to people this network of abusers, nefarious bastards in position of power are able to exert this kind of influence over society as a whole</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Andrea: Yes.</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Dan&amp;amp;Don: So, what type of things was he telling you at first when he was having these flashbacks?</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Andrea: I mean it started when he had a flashback when looking in the mirror &#8211; this was very stunning &#8211; there I realized that he had experienced violence this was the starting, you know, and then all of a sudden he started &#8211; one example I always tell &#8211; because it is the most horrific and also the most embarrassing one, even to talk about it: he was tortured with a toilet brush. So, he took a toilet brush and all of a sudden he had the memory (trigger) &#8220;I know this, I know this toilet brush&#8221; and he was crying for hours, shouting, shivering, panicking but you know, there are different ways a child can cry, as a parent you see when it is panic, horrific&#8230; But one can also it on children from others &#8211; but back, so he was crying like crazy and first I thought, well, yes, they might have him beaten him with this, until I found out over hours or even weeks, that they used the handle of the toilet brush to penetrate him with that, to sodomize him with that. And, one hand &#8211; you know &#8211; you have your tortured child, so you have no doubt that his happened and on the other hand &#8211; just imagine &#8211; you as a parent, now have to go to police, to prosecution office and tell them, well, yes this happened.</p>
<p>Who should believe you, so these groups (and networks) are bestial brilliant to always put the blame on you as a concerned parent as well on the children, as no one would believe it.</p>
<p>After all these torture happenings &#8211; water-boarding, he was rolled into a carpet&#8230; he was trained to act as a baby prostitute (etc.) and you as a concerned parent, you have to explain prosecution office, police that this can happen, that this does happen and, that even many perpetrators were present whom he had to name &#8220;mummy&#8221; or &#8220;daddy&#8221;. So, you come with this quite weird stuff, if you do not anything about satanic ritual abuse, ritual abuse &#8211; child trafficking &#8211; or mk ultra &#8211; you nearly have no chance to get someone to listen to you. And, what is very interesting, I several times offered authorities they can examine me psychiatrically, they even can have my son &#8211; after a detailed examination over CT/MRT/(nuclear medical examination) &#8211; and if my son would not have anything&#8230; he can live with his &#8220;father&#8221; &#8211; I really offered anything and they (courts, authorities) denied, denied, denied.</p>
<p>So, it is very difficult when you are in this situation as a parent to even get an examination for these children. And, there is the Istanbul Protocol from the United Nations, so hundreds of torture specialists wrote these (guidelines) for torture cases &#8211; a guideline for acting in torture cases &#8211; this is now the official recommendation from the United Nations, and the point is, no one knows about it or claims not to know about it and if you have a tortured child no one is helping these children.</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Dan&amp;amp;Don: Now, when this first started happening, what did you think that it might be first, or did you think automatically that it was this?</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Andrea: We here in Austria do not know anything about satanic ritual abuse or MK ultra. So, I had no idea what was going on but thanks to the information my son was able to give me about the perpetrators, I realized that they are well well educated, they are university professors, physicians, psychologists, so I knew that they are no idiots, you know. So, I just thought, there must be something, a bigger structure behind that&#8230; Because they would not take such a risk and they would not be able to do it so professionally, you know, the way I saw that my son was trained as a baby prostitute&#8230; was highly professional. It was heartbreaking, heart-breaking, but I realized that this was done on a highly professional level.</p>
<p>Or situations, where he changed personalities, I named it &#8220;he changed his status or consciousness&#8221; I did not realize that he already was a split personality with deliberately caused multiple personality disorder &#8211; I did not know this (in those days), so I described it differently.</p>
<p>So, there was a personality which did not recognize me any more: I was with him on the street and all of a sudden, he changed into this alter and he did not see me anymore (standing in front of him), so he was like standing alone on the street, trying to join other adults.</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>And from &#8220;small&#8221; &#8211; let´s say &#8220;small&#8221; things &#8211; I realized &#8220;O my god, this is a huge, huge, huge systematic thing done on him&#8221;.</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Dan&amp;amp;Don: So, if you suspect that your child is maybe a victim of this, what are the symptoms that you would normally look out for? Besides from what you already said.</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Andrea: I mean the first symptoms, during the first visits were, that he came home very ill, you know. I was at the doctor´s with him nearly twice a week and the doctor´s  &#8211; the paediatric, meaning the child physicians &#8211; always prescribed him antibiotics. Now I know they described him antibiotics all the time to heal his inner wounds, because you nearly never see some wounds or bruises.</p>
<p>White torture is used &#8211; so, you cannot track water-boarding, you cannot track (all kinds of white torture) &#8211; so, they often roll the children into carpets to beat them there, because this does not leave traces&#8230; And, he already was &#8220;clean&#8221; we say in German, meaning he was able to go on his own to his potty, so, I did not check his genitals, his anus in detail. And what I know now is, that &#8211; or pricking with needles, they pricked his tooth root canal &#8211; they use everything that does not leave VISIBLE traces.</p>
<p>So the first symptoms are that they get ill, very ill, are stopping to talk, he already was able to talk, also, he needed soothers again and, he had enormous mood swings, unexplainable at the beginning and after he was already programmed &#8211; at least the basic steps of programming were done &#8211; after some breaks in visiting his &#8220;father&#8221; &#8211; all the things came out, one after the next, over months&#8230;</p>
<p>Another symptom, this is very important because it is heart-breaking &#8211; those children are always surrounded with perpetrators. So, take very care, when you child liked a (former) friend, a family member, a neighbour, (etc.) and all of a sudden, the toddler is telling you this person is not nice anymore. Take really care when this is happening, especially in this age when it is a five year old child, it might be a mood or the child might be just playing but especially serious when it is a toddler, because these groups are &#8211; meaning no single person can do this harm &#8211; so they are operating in groups, so you have involved neighbours, involved family members and you have involved acquaintances and it is also convincing the child that you would be cooperating unconsciously, because your child is told &#8220;your mummy or your daddy &#8230;&#8221; &#8211; I also know many concerned fathers&#8230; as protective fathers &#8230;. They always tell the child, &#8220;your mother or your father&#8230; want that you have now &#8220;ouch&#8221; &#8211; he/she is agreeing on that&#8221;.</p>
<p>And it is very stressing on a soul level as a protective parent, having no clue about the situation and the child who is experiencing this double-bind situation, that you are in contact with the perpetrators, meaning the protective mother or father is in contact with the perpetrators (without knowing).</p>
<p>And my son was convinced over weeks, that I wanted him to be tortured. &#8211; &#8211; &#8211;</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Dan&amp;amp;Don: This is terrible.</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Andrea: Yes, yes.</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Dan&amp;amp;Don: Was there a family member involved in your case?</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Andrea. Yes, actually my whole family is involved. It took me quite a while to find out &#8211; he told me quite late about family members involved &#8211; because they were close, they were I mean I was even phoning with them, telling them about his torture. He was listening while I was phoning with family members&#8230; So, I was even allowing his so called &#8220;grandmother&#8221; to babysit him, while I was at courts trying to find help for him (&#8230;) So of course &#8211; this was also done to re-trigger him, and she (at least) re-triggered him, and so on&#8230; So, I brought this to courts (too), nevertheless courts ignored it, and now I know of course, years later, that I grew up in a total mk ultra family</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Dan&amp;amp;Don: So, from your page (www.traumabasedmindcontrol.com) it seems as courts were complicit and took care that the case would never see the light of the day.</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Andrea: Yes, yes, yes. What I also know now is, that they were phoning around (to manipulate, influence, betray officials where necessary), I mean I had many former friends or acquaintances who were involved so, seemingly it was a whole set-up my live which I did not realize because I did not realize that I am programmed, mk-ed myself. So, on one hand it was heart-breaking for me to see that all friends or acquaintances were joining the crime because my son already told me and on the other hand, I felt so free, it was so much healing in this information itself, you know.</p>
<p>That might sound a bit weird, but truth is always healing. And I also realized this with my son first: Every single story that he was able to tell me meant healing for him &#8211; instant healing &#8211; like with a finger snip, you know. So, as heart-breaking as it is it is healing.</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Dan&amp;amp;Don: That´s good, at least.</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Andrea: Yes, and sorry, for all parents that might be in this situation, what it is also extremely heart-breaking, is, my son claimed for example that I am not his mummy anymore &#8230; he was not allowed not allowed to call me &#8220;mummy&#8221; anymore but &#8220;Andrea&#8221; &#8211; he had to call me with my first name and it is heart-breaking, when you are dedicated parent and all of a sudden your child claims &#8220;you are not my mummy &#8211; you are not my father &#8211; anymore&#8221; and it took me actually years to find out what was going on until &#8211; there was this tape from the pizzagate researchers &#8211; &#8211; they have it on audio, how it comes to the point that a child has to say to others &#8211; to strangers &#8211; mum and dad &#8211; caused via plain horrific torture.</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Dan&amp;amp;Don: And how old is your son, now?</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Andrea: 2 to 2 1/2years was the period (&#8230;)</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Dan&amp;amp;Don: Oh now, sorry, how old he is currently right now in the present?</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Andrea: Currently present he is 10 years now.</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Dan&amp;amp;Don: So, this has been ongoing for a while?</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Andrea: Yes, ongoing for a while, yes. And the last horrific thing that happened &#8211; I mean already in 2011, when he was 2 1/2yrs old, he told me that he now would be a girlie, that he would not be able to get children and told me about castration, that they told him at least that they would have him castrated &#8211; they do this quite often by crushing the inner genitals &#8211; or pricking with needles (into the inner genitals) &#8211; &#8211; or taking out even the bulbourethral gland &#8211; but that is something technical you can read this up on my website &#8211; and, in addition to this &#8211; they sent me a picture of him, this January 2019, a few months ago without any comment, where I saw, that he already lost &#8211; ALL &#8211; his adult teeth. This is often caused via torture, via electroshock or other means so, am they show me &#8211; again &#8211; openly that my beloved son is tortured. I wrote to court again &#8211; prosecution office AND family court &#8211; and all I get back is &#8220;there is no initial suspicion&#8221; &#8211; not to even have a look on the boy, not to have him examined in detail.</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Dan&amp;amp;Don: Well, it makes you wonder how much of this stuff authorities are covering up? You know, because it is not just one person, you know what I mean?</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Andrea: Yes. I mean this is the &#8211; it took me quite some time to find out &#8211; at least at the moment I think to be honest &#8211; I think that I was groomed for this role to create a kind of strategic entanglement machinery, because every single doctor, physicians, psychologist, therapist, teacher, kindergartener (pre-school teacher) prosecution officer, judge, police officer &#8211; they are all entangled because it would be their duty to help this child. And by covering-up, preventing him from basic medical examinations and treatment is a crime, also here in Austria. A severe crime, because torture &#8211; it´s like murder, you can get even jailed for helping or allowing torture actually you can get jailed even 60 years afterwards, you know.</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Dan&amp;amp;Don: Yes, there is no here we call it &#8220;statute of limitation&#8221;, how much time it is past between when the crime was actually committed and the present day.</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Andrea: Yes, exactly. Thank you for the technical term. Same here &#8211; and so I am very worried, extremely worried that they are going to kill my son therefore, then claim the child would have had an accident.</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Dan&amp;amp;Don: So, what do you estimate is the point of it, why they are doing this to all the children?</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Andrea: I mean, we call it (egg-laying wool milk pig) &#8211; I mean &#8211; you just have if you are a psychopath and think like a psychopath, I grew up with them, so I know much about how they think, you just have advantages: You can first use these children as part of their basic mind fracture as baby prostitutes. The younger they are the more money you get. Then secondly you have the satanic component, you can do a lot of black magic rituals, energy transfers, experimentations within some satanic cults and then you have the third row of physicians, doing plain mk ultra research, improving their programs or even try to sell a certain type of program. So, everyone is earning from that, as well on top it is known, that the Nazis started to do this &#8211; you can entangle a whole population with this crime.</p>
<p>We know for example, many whistle-blowers are talking about it, that you can be invited to a huge event, and you are proud because you think, yes, well this is important for my career your ego is (getting big) and you are excited to be there and we know that they are mixing drugs into the drinks there and then they let you participate in some (torture) rituals. So, of course this is filmed, and from then on, if you don´t go to police, to prosecution office and report about the drugs, the torture and hand yourself in, you are entangled.</p>
<p>And the next step is, that they can also ask for your children. And grandchildren.</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Dan&amp;amp;Don: We knew this for quite a long time that they use this type of stuff as a black mail device.</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Andrea: Yes.</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Dan&amp;amp;Don: You do not even have to necessarily participate in it, a picture of you in a room is enough.</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Andrea: Yes. I mean this is the most common procedure for those who are not in SRA or MK ultra. But here in Austria seemingly &#8211; I mean we have here the old Nazi home-base, I mean Adolf Hitler was Austrian &#8211; the SS academy of physicians was brought to Austria, to Graz, that is a town 2 hours away from Vienna &#8211; in 1940, so still SS academy of physicians is operating here &#8211; it was never shut down, so we have here such a high density of SRA and MK ultra in general population.</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Dan&amp;amp;Don: So, you say this is perpetrated basically by the 4th REICH?</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Andrea: Yes, this is interesting, we have here 4th REICH but we have here also at least as my research goes to at the moment, I think we have here extremely strong THULE, with THULE I mean the combination of VRIL, the 4th REICH and the Vatican. Now also &#8211; unfortunately in Vienna &#8211; also having large co-operations with MOSSAD and with Russian secret service. Vienna for example was always said to be a melting pot of the secret services of the east and west, as it is a country, meaning a city, on the former boarder of east and west. So, we here have any secret services and they are sitting &#8211; I mean for us it is here the Nazis, there the Jews, then the Muslims &#8211; but we know that in their free-masonic lodges &#8211; or in their power centres they are sitting around one table together.</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Dan&amp;amp;Don: Yes, wow. You know within our own research we discovered that that the THULE is actually behind the rise of the Nazi party.</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Andrea: Yes</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Dan&amp;amp;Don: They basically installed Hitler.</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Andrea: They installed Hitler, they financed him. I mean there was so much money available for their research, for their military equipment, for their space flying saucers and so on&#8230; Even just look at their clothes, they were made by the later designer Hugo Boss. So, they had even designer cloths. Who paid for this in a country that had no money after the 1st world war?</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Dan&amp;amp;Don: They were financed from Switzerland. I have learned everything from living in a military town &#8211; it is you have to look out where people go to receive funding for things &#8211; and &#8211; yeah &#8211; funding is king. It is funny, because the first time I ever heard about this about the whole concept about SRA, about satanic ritual abuse was that someone I used to be friends with from high-school and her mum told me that she basically got turned on into a conspiracy theory about this worldwide network of paedophiles that was basically run by the Vatican.</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Andrea: Wow.</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Dan&amp;amp;Don: And the Jesuit order was actually on the centre of it.</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Andrea: Yes, exactly &#8211; I also always land at the Jesuits (doing research) &#8211; And the interesting thing for example, the brother of Wernher von Braun &#8211; Wernher von Braun, the rocket scientist and head of NASA and so on &#8211; his brother &#8211; Sigismund (von Braun) &#8211; was a diplomat in the Vatican.</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Dan&amp;amp;Don: Really?</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Andrea: Yes.</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Dan&amp;amp;Don: I did not know that.</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Andrea: So, you have the connection within one click. And of course, we have here mostly Nazis or former Nazis but especially in our own case, my son recognized perpetrators from Nazi families and from Jewish families committing the crime hand in hand. So, that does not make the situation easier, and actually when I am going against one group, the other comes and attacks me back&#8230; and they are protecting each other.</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Dan&amp;amp;Don: Yeah, I think that it is a mistake to counter column. Nazis were behind it, because Nazis were just a creation of occult societies and THULE was basically all the ones who were active in Germany and suck them all up in form of a super cult. So, I mean even though the Nazi party is long gone the actually driving force behind it is still well active, still rock n rolling. And then you get the ties to the O.T.O from that. Do you want to speak on that Dan?</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Andrea: The O.T.O &#8211; I did not get that?</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Dan&amp;amp;Don: Well as far I know Aleister Crowley started the O.T.O</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Andrea: Ahh &#8211; O.T.O  &#8211; yes of course</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Dan&amp;amp;Don: during world war 2, they were magical tools between the British lodges the leftovers of the &#8220;Golden Dawn&#8221; then the VRIL, all basically started out of Blavatsky teachings&#8230; from what I can understand. &#8211; &#8211; &#8211; Right.</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Andrea: The O.T.O was even founded in Vienna. Austria.</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Dan&amp;amp;Don: Yeah, I believe that. The closest chapter here is I think in Baltimore. Yes, this is probably 6-8 hours away from us.</p>
<p>Andrea: Wow. And you know, the interesting thing, for me at least, but it might be also interesting for you for example perpetrators my son was able to recognize, especially the older ones, Americans survivors in their 30ies, in their 40ies in their 60ies recognized the same perpetrators as their programmers, as their handlers, as their trainers. So, this group is operating worldwide it is not so huge as it seems. My impression is that the core programmers are still alive Mengele is still alive, Aribert Heim is still alive and they are not giving out of their hands their basic knowledge &#8211; that´s at least my impression.</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Dan&amp;amp;Don: So, where would you think he is hiding, if Mengele was still around, in Brazil or &#8211; &#8211; &#8211; Argentina?</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Andrea: There are many reports that Mengele is in New York, looking like in his 50ies or 60ies</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Dan&amp;amp;Don:  Really?</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Andrea: Yes, I believe that too. And first, you know, I was studying with comparative literature and there I was dealing a lot with the 3rd REICH and the Jewish survivor reports of the concentrations camps and some of them were saying, &#8220;they are still here&#8221; &#8211; they were saying this in the 90ies &#8211; &#8220;they are still here, they are still attacking us&#8221; &#8211; and I was wondering what was going on with them, why were they so afraid, so there were many Jewish survivors claiming that &#8211; the same with American MK ultra survivor Wendy Hoffman, she is also Jewish. She is reporting &#8211; that is highly interesting &#8211; that Josef Mengele was starting her MK ultra programming in the early 40ies &#8211; in New York &#8211; long before the war ended. So, this is all a cover-up, everything was prepared that the Nazis will be then transferred to America in my opinion.</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Dan&amp;amp;Don: Yes, officially we have in the books that we had operation paperclip &#8211; &#8211; &#8211; project paperclip &#8211; &#8211; &#8211; yes, excuse me &#8211; &#8211; but, you know what I was saying about the O.T.O and all these occult orders having the same core stuff (&#8230;) so it does not really matter, it is all the occult order. So, very easily for them to have &#8211; you know &#8211; we have the same type of society here in the US and we had them in those times &#8211; so here we have your networks.</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Andrea: Yes, yes. I think on one hand they have these regression technologies for themselves and on the other hand they are playing a lot with time travel. So, I have concrete memories on my own programming now that I was talking with my own programmer recently, meaning one year ago.</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Dan&amp;amp;Don: So, well how did that conversation go?</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>(all laughing)</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Andrea: Well, from my own story just to give a frame for that it took me years even after the situation with my son happened that I realized that I was total MK ultra too, because my programming is on one hand extremely well done and on the other hand extremely well hidden. So, when I am changing alters one nearly cannot see any difference &#8211; and no one can see it. So, a friend of mine, Miesha Johnston, she is also working with me for years now, is also stating that she cannot see a difference on me (when changing alters). So, this just to give a frame for it. But over the years I got some hints and, I realized when I was in Norway, actually, I realized that during a deep meditation a kind of portal was opening it felt as if my bed would get wheels, my bed would have been driven into another room, then an airlock of a military base would have been opened&#8230; &#8211; I was in plain shock and just shouted &#8220;No, I do not agree, I do not consent&#8221; &#8211; and then I was driven back, so I realized that I was fetched by a portal technology.</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Dan&amp;amp;Don: So, when you say portal technology, are you talking about like people from a secret space program or a breakaway civilization, are we talking about the same portal technology?</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Andrea: No much more practical. If they want to fetch you, they just need a kind of electromagnetic frequency I call it &#8211; I am unfortunately not a technician &#8211; but they just can fetch you where ever you are. So this I was experiencing on your own, you are lying on your bed or you are sleeping and they just take you and for you it feels as if your bed would get wheels and you are transported into &#8211; I do not know if I was on this planet or off-planet &#8211; but they just take you to a complete different location, and the same way I was brought back.</p>
<p>And there, I have memories, talking for example to one of the not so well-known Nazi programmers, Aribert Heim, but he was (has been) a close colleague of Joseph Mengele.</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Dan&amp;amp;Don: Do you think maybe that there is any possibility that the portal technology or the leaving could be screen memories?</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Andrea: No, &#8211; no, because it was not just ones, I had many of them&#8230; &#8230; I don´t think it was a screen memory actually, no. Because also during regression it was confirmed. So, I have memories on my own, meaning I made the experience during deep meditation several times &#8211; and during regression it was confirmed. But, I mean, talking about screen memories: All could be screen memories but it would be for too much in sum for screen memories, you know. I also found out during a session that I was programmed at the Wewelsburg castle in Germany.</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Dan&amp;amp;Don: And that´s the place where the Black Sun and the 4th REICH is located, right?</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Andrea: Yes, it is Himmler´s occult castle. And I found out later, later I did research, many are telling the same stories, that they were laying there on the black sun symbol&#8230; getting programmed or tortured or whatsoever. So, it cannot be a screen memory of all of us, you know.</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Dan&amp;amp;Don: Right. You know it was not to be like accusatory or anything.</p>
<p>Andrea: I understand. I question myself a lot about it and actually, maybe, I think often too long</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>(all laughing)</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Dan&amp;amp;Don: You know, it´s been discussed in some of the circles that are circulate through that they now have the possibility to place false memories in your head &#8211; dark city style. You know, they can take a memory from one person and implant it into another.</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Andrea: Yes, of course they can. But, you know, there are always &#8211; how is it called &#8211; injuries (scars) on your body. So why I do have these problems with my coccyx or with my tailbone? &#8211; without having any memories about an accident. Why do I have quite crippled pointing fingers without any memories? Of course, from torture. Why do I have memories like &#8211; actually I had the ability to store memories like an audio recorder or video recorder in my brain. Too many things that cannot get explained via consciousness transfer or implanted memories, you know. But I am very aware of the situation, that not everything is true. And I am very careful in my research, therefore.</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Dan&amp;amp;Don: Right.</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Andrea: And, I am just talking about things, where I am 100% sure.</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Dan&amp;amp;Don: We are like the opposite &#8211; (laughing) &#8211; we are going on air every week and are just (talking about everything) I mean on our show we are not afraid of wild connection  &#8211; &#8211; &#8211; We speculate quite often. A great deal, it is pretty much the point of our show &#8211; it is wild speculation. But you know we also try to provide a platform where everyone can come in a non-judgmental atmosphere and let the audience decide on their own. And, I wanna thank you for coming on and talking about this &#8211; &#8211; &#8211; And I understand that you are taking incredible risk by doing it, but the risk not doing it is even bigger.</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Andrea: I made a decision, I mean, my son, shortly before he was taken, I asked him &#8211; we knew it could happen because there was the imminent danger of course &#8211; so I asked him, what I should do in such a case, meaning if I should focus on him or for him and all his little friends, and he said &#8211; of course in his language in these days &#8211; please fight for me and all those other children. So, he told me what to do and I am going on with that of course.</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Dan&amp;amp;Don: So, how would you go about trying to &#8211; or would it even be advisable &#8211; to merge personalities that have been fractured due to trauma-based mind control?</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Andrea: You mean, in terms of healing?</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Dan&amp;amp;Don: Yes.</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Andrea: I mean, on one hand it is a very long process and on the other hand it is going very quickly, depending, if secret service or the cults who think they would own you are leaving you alone or not. So, for example Miesha Johnston is doing wonderful sessions with me as a hypnotherapist, but, for example after every single session I am fetched and memories are again deleted. So, I just have the audio recordings and it is very difficult to come into this memory flow. So, healing is possible very quickly in my opinion when you are left in peace. That´s my message, you know. And many are also, like we do know from other secret space whistle-blowers like Penny Bradley who is a friend of mine and a colleague &#8211; she is also under attack. So, the point is: Are you left in peace, are you attacked by direct energy weapons, are you poisoned, are there murder attempts against you or are you even fetched and your memories are wiped out again and again and again?</p>
<p>And what cannot get healed &#8211; sorry, just one sentence &#8211; what cannot be healed, if you have mutilations, for example, this cannot be healed and even if I would get back my son now, I cannot give him back his childhood.</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Dan&amp;amp;Don: right.</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Andrea: Same here with me, but alters can be integrated, alters can be found, it is not such a big deal, but most of us are not left alone, they do not let us live in peace, that´s &#8211; for most of us &#8211; the problem, I think.</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Dan&amp;amp;Don: During all your healing, have you figured out, what the intend was for your mind fracture?</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Andrea: The intend for my mind fracture?</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Dan&amp;amp;Don: Yes, what did they use you for?</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Andrea: What I have found out so far, but this section is blocked the most, is, that I was used I have memories of being used for small or smallest agency jobs. I was used in Montauk seemingly my ability was or is to search for or to find certain things they used this ability a lot</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Dan&amp;amp;Don: Now, was that something like astral travel or remote viewing or was that something different?</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Andrea: My memories are more remote viewing based.</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Dan&amp;amp;Don: okay, they were using you as a remote viewer.</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Andrea: this at least I know at the moment, and it is &#8211; at the moment very difficult to find them (&#8230;) And seemingly in some point in time they started to use me for the role I am playing now because for me it cannot be a coincidence, you know&#8230; &#8230; also the studies, my whole education. I mean why did I study comparative literature? So, you are good in observing, in puzzling together text pieces&#8230; then, I have an education in business, in statistics, &#8230; then also as a counsellor, trainer coach &#8211; so, I don´t think this is a coincidence, I really think they trained me to be capable for the role I am doing now. So, it is a bestial cynical game actually. you know?</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Dan&amp;amp;Don: Yes, it is seemingly.</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Andrea: And first, I thought, wow, you are so lucky to have all these educations and over the years I tend to think, well, was it really my decision? You know what I mean?</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Dan&amp;amp;Don: Yes, and earlier you talked about shifting from one personality in the other and it was not indistinguishable so that´s kind of scary for me &#8211; how do you even know then, like of how much of what you are doing is wanted to be done and how much is a programming? Like you are coming to my show right now, you know what I am saying?</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Andrea: I mean, I am used to that, everyone who is programmed is used to that. It is normal &#8211; I recognize it now better when I am in a program, I have the classical &#8220;fight or flight&#8221; modus, this are signs for me that now I am in a program or in an alter that is suggesting that there is no other way. Or, in the early years I found out that when I am extremely ill, I start to look the brightest&#8230; I start to shine, you know. This is done via extreme torture &#8220;no one is allowed to realize how you are really feeling&#8221;.</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Dan&amp;amp;Don: Yes, that´s bad. &#8211; &#8211; &#8211; The sense of isolation is overwhelming.</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Andrea: Isolation?</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Dan&amp;amp;Don: Yes, having the secret, not being able to tell the world that this stuff is happening and happened.</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Andrea: I mean, I can tell the world.</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Dan&amp;amp;Don: I mean like for the victims&#8230;</p>
<p>Andrea: I mean is a huge point in my life, that´s why I stopped here. They keep me well isolated; I am living here in a small studio actually in Vienna and they are keeping me in principle isolated for years now. I have fortunately friends all over the world which can be met over the internet, but there are no local friends, there is no local network and, over the years &#8211; it is maybe also interesting &#8211; even after the thing happened to Luki, my son I was brought into an even more sever isolation over secret service agents: They come as helpers, they come as friends and, over months and years you realize, well now I am completely isolated.</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Dan&amp;amp;Don: Have you lived in Austria your entire life?</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Andrea: Mostly, yes. I lived several months in London, in the beginning in 2013, where I tried desperately to find help for my son, I lived and worked in London for about 6-9 months, then I lived also in Asia, after a murder attempt I had to fly and lived in a Buddhist monastery to find some healing then I was a few months in Switzerland, then I was in Norway and most of the time I was accompanied by secret service officials, so they are really eager to prevent you from working on one hand, re-trigger you, re-program you, keep you ready for whatsoever, you know to target you.</p>
<p>And what they also do, especially in the early years, they do a lot of &#8211; this is extremely important for the audience &#8211; they do a lot of what we call &#8220;operative psychology&#8221; this means &#8220;erosion of the soul&#8221; &#8211; &#8220;ZERSETZUNG&#8221;: They really try to kill you by killing your soul or hurting your soul so much that you either get really insane, or you commit suicide or you knock at the door of a psychiatry and ask to live there for the rest of your life. And this is extremely dangerous &#8211; I am not joking about this &#8211; for example one of the first helpers that was here, was from the secret service &#8211; officially he wanted to help me and my son &#8211; and sitting in my living room and having coffee with him, all of a sudden I thought, O my god, I had the feeling now I am getting crazy to be honest, as there was so much cognitive dissonance in this meeting until out I found out, that he was one of the torturers of my son.</p>
<p>And it sounds very easy now here, when I tell this, but when you are in this situation, it is nearly unbearable. And they love, for example, to send you agents, that were involved in the torture &#8211; it is extremely important for breaking you down on a soul level because your unconsciousness knows it &#8211; just you as a person does not know it and &#8211; after this did not work anymore &#8211; because when you find it out once you find it out much quicker the next time, and so on, so it does not work any more</p>
<p>What they also did, for your audience this is also important, they recorded the torture events of my beloved son meaning his crying, begging for help, crying for me and then, they sent me these happenings over white noises (into my living room). So, the same is going on, you are unconsciously on a soul level listening to that and you do not hear it directly, because it is white noises and I promise you, if you do not find out, you are getting insane, it is nearly unbearable. As soon as you find out it does not hurt you so much and you can try to record it and then often it immediately stops.</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Dan&amp;amp;Don: Do you think this is what could have happened to the diplomats in Cuba? And a couple of other places, I think China, there are diplomats claiming to be sonically attacked.</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Andrea: I think yes, because even if it is not your child it is breaking down every sentient being. It is unbearable, it is really unbearable. Because on a soul level it is eroding your soul, it is weakening you and you have no idea because you do not hear anything, you know. So, yes, my opinion is this could be.</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Dan&amp;amp;Don: So, is there any way you could possibly shield yourself from that besides from living in a</p>
<p>deprivation chamber</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>(all laughing)</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Andrea: I think the most important thing is to know because what you know cannot kill you or cannot drive you insane you can do something about it. General protection is very difficult for example, because I was sitting in Norway in a small little Fjord, you know and they came to electroshock me in my living-room from outside.</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Dan&amp;amp;Don: what?</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Andrea: yes.</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Dan&amp;amp;Don: That´s terrible.</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Andrea: and this device can be bought in any shop worldwide. Even privately, so even we could buy it if we wanted to, you know. So, it is more important to find out what is going on, and about the mechanism how the secret service operatives and their satanic crews are operating then to protect, because you cannot be so protected, they most often find a new way, you know.</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Dan&amp;amp;Don: right. Always a countermeasure.</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Andrea: Yes, and for example in the settlement where I live in Vienna half of the settlement thinks I would have (tried) to commit suicide because a secret service officer told them so&#8230;</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Dan&amp;amp;Don: really?</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Andrea: yes, the other third thinks I am insane (and the few left do have children in mk ultra or SRA/child trafficking programs on their own)</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Dan&amp;amp;Don: Just to clarify, when you say secret service, are you talking about something over there or are you talking about the US secret service?</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Andrea: Oh, no, here in Austria I talk about local Austrian secret service.</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Dan&amp;amp;Don: Okay</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Andrea: And, I even after a murder attempt, I mentioned them even with name, picture, address towards prosecution office, but they do not mind.</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Dan&amp;amp;Don: So, in Austria, what would be the secret service be in charge of? What would be their main job? Here in America, their only job is to protect the president.</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Andrea: Aha, okay, I did not know that.</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Dan&amp;amp;Don: yeah, we got the CIA and the NSA, they are all intelligence agencies. The (&#8230;) defence agencies, the whole we call them alphabet agencies&#8230; but the secret service basically is just here to protect the president&#8230; Yes, the CIA and the FBI are the 2 big intelligence agencies that most people know about</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Andrea: Okay. Here in Austria we have the situation that general population does not know that secret service does even exist. So, when you start to talk secret service, they more tend to think that you are insane, they are so brain-washed so, this means that Austrian secret service is excellent because a population that does not know that the agency exists shows that the agency did a brilliant job.</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Dan&amp;amp;Don: So, this would be more a &#8220;men in black&#8221; agency than the CIA? The men in black, that do not exist to investigate UFO, (&#8230;) or they come and collect evidence on topics that technically do not exist? Yeah &#8211; they are part of an organization, that´s so secret that there is no name for it.</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Andrea: Yes, something more like this. And you know, they more look like we do&#8230; they are caretakers of houses, housewives, pensioners, invalids, &#8230;they really have a brilliant stuff, you know it is not &#8211; we all have still have in our mind the James Bond type.</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Dan&amp;amp;Don: Right</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>(all laughing)</p>
<p>Andrea: And when someone is not looking like this type it cannot be, you know.</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Dan&amp;amp;Don: So, you have to look on your watch and I am sure a good portion of old Europe remembers secret police</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>(all laughing)</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Andrea: So, it is extremely difficult here in Austria. We here are also not allowed to talk about UFOs and not allowed to talk (actually think) about aliens.</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Dan&amp;amp;Don: Really?</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Andrea: Yes, we are so brainwashed, even I am I have to admit. I have really troubles to talk about aliens&#8230; &#8230; because it is so forbidden here that you do not dare (even think about it), you know?</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Dan&amp;amp;Don: Yeah, American culture is pretty obsessed with aliens and there is a state in the US that made a law that made it illegal to get abducted</p>
<p>(all laughing)</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Andrea: really?</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Dan&amp;amp;Don: Can you believe that?</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Andrea: Yes, but this is free speech and we must not forget that we are here in the Nazi home-base so why are they the brainwashing the population even to not dare to think about it? Of course, we have a lot of alien contacts a lot of (informal) bases, a lot of UFOs but it is the best protection, no?</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Dan&amp;amp;Don: Yes, I guess so it is given a giant stigma I mean it used to have a pretty big stigma here too, but it is losing up in the last 20, 30 years I would say. &#8211; &#8211; &#8211; Well, we are speaking here about the CIA there it was said, everything you see on TV, everything you hear on radio anything that makes its way into the mass consciousness, is what we call culture changing, is you know &#8211; basically the powers that be taking these ideas and grounding them into the American Zeitgeist. So, are you are familiar over there in Austria with the Tavistock institute?</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Andrea: Yes, of course.</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Dan&amp;amp;Don: So, a lot of techniques come from them for mass penetration. And repeating chunk at the psyche on a mass level &#8211; &#8211; &#8211; So, I think the way it worked here is, keep this under-wiring sort of theme, that if anybody talks about it like UFOs or extra-terrestrials, yeah, they are crazy, but&#8230; since we have such a hard time making everything who is seeing something in the sky look crazy&#8230; we are just getting here &#8220;not talk about it&#8221; or &#8220;make it part of the culture&#8221;.</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Andrea: Yeah, I mean, you really have freedom of speech, you must not forget this.</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Dan&amp;amp;Don: Yes, for now.</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Andrea: And you had gorgeous whistle-blowers, activists, scientists over the last 60 years actually who did so much from any angle of the truther scenes&#8230; basic field research &#8211; Anthony J. Hilder, Cooper &#8211; I now miss his first name &#8211;</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Dan&amp;amp;Don: Bill Cooper &#8211; &#8211; &#8211; Milton William &#8220;Bill&#8221; Cooper</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Andrea: than all those dealing with SRA and MK ultra, so without you Americans I think I would not be alive anymore, because I think they would have broken me.</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Dan&amp;amp;Don: Well, on behalf of America, Thank you.</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>(all laughing)</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Andrea: thank you, America.</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Dan&amp;amp;Don: You know, I mean I get the feeling, all of that is coming up backyards, as we recently had a few stories shared in the group &#8211; this is just in 2 days ago &#8211; that 2 major child trafficking rings are broken up, one in Detroit and one in Georgia.</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Andrea: Child smuggling rings?</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Dan&amp;amp;Don: Yes, and we are in Virginia.</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Andrea: I mean, this news with smuggling rings, this is great for the concerned children, but then you maybe safe a few hundreds, you know. But, in my opinion it is more important to get out the whole thing what was done on them in terms of programming? Because then they are taken out from the smuggling rings and placed into foster places where they are ongoing programmed or used for whatsoever. So, we have to raise the awareness, in my opinion how the procedure is done on toddlers and small children because otherwise we cannot stop the whole issue. And these children are becoming perpetrators on their own, not all of them, but many. So, the number is raising of course, also the numbers of perpetrators are raising.</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Dan&amp;amp;Don: Well there is a never-ending leak of horror stories that emerged from CPS &#8211; child protection services, the whole foster care system &#8211; you know, juvenile courts, there is a never-ending laundry list of horror stories emerging from those sectors.</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Andrea: Yes, Nancy Schaefer, I think she was an American senator&#8230; she was collecting materials about your CPS and she was suicided with her husband, I think 1 or 3 days before the hearing</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Dan&amp;amp;Don: Something we have to dig into &#8211; &#8211; &#8211; Yeah.</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Andrea: Much is published about her, so you can find her &#8211; Nancy Schaefer is/was her name. (&lt;a href=&#8221;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Schaefer&#8221;&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Schaefer&lt;/a&gt;)</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Dan&amp;amp;Don: Sounds familiar. Was she investigating Haiti?</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Andrea: She was investigating the CPS.</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Dan&amp;amp;Don: So, just CPS, so she was not investigating child trafficking in Haiti?</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Andrea: Not Haiti &#8211; as far as I know, not Haiti &#8211; but child trafficking and CPS and money laundering there out of child trafficking.</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Dan&amp;amp;Don: Well, it is commonly known, at least in conspiracy theory circles that there are terrible things being done behind closed doors by the elites. So, the Clinton foundation is involved in Haiti&#8230; this guy Jeff Epstein, what is referred to as &#8220;rape island&#8221; in the US Virgin islands&#8230; &#8230; you know the Clintons made multiple trips there, probably twice as often as Trump but &#8211; yes &#8211; he has been there, then Weinstein, Harvey Weinstein &#8211; &#8211; &#8211;  Just recently too, then we have this Nxivm cult getting broken up in the same type of thing &#8211; I have not heard anything about children involved in that one but this one was more human trafficking &#8211; &#8211; &#8211; Keith Raniere got locked up for taking pictures with 15year old girls (beside other things)</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Andrea: Okay</p>
<p>Dan&amp;amp;Don: the whole pizzagate thing, and you know people who want to laugh about that claiming &#8220;pizzagate is not real&#8221; &#8211; thinking it was just about the guy owning the pizza restaurant (&#8230;)</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Andrea: I mean this is extremely important and I am so glad that other guys are doing this research but what I, what for me is more interesting, all those guys you mentioned, Weinstein, Clintons, etc. &#8211; all those guys are MK ultra themselves. So, also my son told me &#8211; this was so interesting &#8211; heart-breaking, heart-breaking: he told me that other toddlers were present and they were forced to do him &#8220;ouch&#8221; &#8211; &#8220;ouch&#8221; was our code for torture, you know. So, the small ones, perpetrators were forcing their own children to torture my son and other children &#8211; so this is part of their mk ultra program &#8211; that they have to do this to other children. And when you see them growing up then, then you have the adult versions of Weinstein, Clinton, however they are called or Bush &#8211; same here in Austria, no difference &#8211; By the way &#8211; Arnold Schwarzenegger &#8211; also involved in all this, is Austrian.</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Dan&amp;amp;Don: You know, you mentioned Bill Clinton being MK &#8211; I met Bill Clinton one time, he was campaigning for his wife, in 2008 or something like that and he was doing some speech for her in a gymnasium and at the time I was involved in a actors groups and we stood there asking questions (&#8230;) &#8211; ambush journalism basically &#8211; (&#8230;) &#8211; so someone dared to ask him about the Bohemian Grove. And when I got to him it was so strange it was as if &#8211; the energy in the room was as if he was a rock star &#8211; he held his speech and he is doing the meet and greet thing and he just: IT was empty. Like his face, it was just like &#8211; you know &#8211; I shook his hand and asked a question and he was just blank face and it all seemed as if he was not even there. It was great.</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Andrea: I mean there is this famous video from him online &#8211; I do not know if you know it &#8211; but where he gets make-up before a speech I think, and there you see, that there is nothing there, that he is just a shell</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Dan&amp;amp;Don: It seemed that way to me. I mean he did the speech well you know &#8211; he seemed alive and well he was giving a speech, but afterwards it was just like if he was looking through everyone. You know, he did not even see anyone in the room.</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Andrea: I think this is more important &#8211; for me it is more important &#8211; to point the fact that they are programmed themselves. That does not mean that they are without guilt of course they need to take back their personal responsibility and liability. you know. But it is important that we know that they are programmed themselves, so were programmed for these roles. So you have all these perverted torture events with small children &#8211; I am not talking about sex, because for a child it is always torture &#8211; when you just think of the body measures of a child or a toddler and an adult man or even woman &#8211; it is torture, but they are programmed to do this. And of course, it is still the responsibility &#8211; even programmed &#8211; of them to seek help, to stop it and overtake responsibility and liability. We must see that they are victims on their own and that even their children are programmed into this role to become perpetrators later on. So, if we do not see it, if we do not recognize it, it never stops.</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Dan&amp;amp;Don: And, yeah, this is kind a common thing with molestation cases and stuff like that that are not necessarily tied into SRA or Mk because there are just people out who do that. And the children themselves turning around and doing it to other children, maybe thinking it was normal as it was done on them. You know, outside of the whole ritual abuse thing, and well, yes if there is on top the whole programming thing, there is no wonder.</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Andrea: Yes. And I mean many survivors are speaking out and say I want to stop this &#8211; so, you have the decision &#8211; I made the decision, many others did so not all victims are becoming perpetrators.</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Dan&amp;amp;Don: Right, so, what do you think I guess the stats &#8211; how many do you think are concerned? (&#8230;.)</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Andrea: Millions.</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Dan&amp;amp;Don: So, I guess if we step up to the plate so to speak to realize that it is happening to you first. I wished, there just were a beam we can use to reveal all of this &#8211; if there exists one, maybe it does I think it is a kind of violation (&#8230;) once you have done this kind of shit (&#8230;)</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Andrea: And I mean there are different levels of programming. Not everyone gets the &#8211; I am now cynical &#8211; gets the governmental programming from the secret service with lifelong torture included. There are many steps from basic child abuse to mk ultra programming and many grey zones, you know. So that´s why I think and many talk about it, that millions are concerned.</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Dan&amp;amp;Don: With that not giving too much information away where I work&#8230; &#8211; everyone knows where you work, Dan &#8211; &#8211; &#8211; Ah, well, I work here in (&#8230;) and this kid says &#8220;mummy, I want this starburst&#8221; and the mummy says &#8220;no, you get the skittles to support the troops&#8221; &#8211; You remember the white and blue skittles they had one day? &#8211; and well, brainwashing starts at home. That was just an anecdote, well I mean cultural conditioning, this kind of programming. You know, it is little things like that, that adds up to overall programming. A computer program is made of lots of bits of codes. Right, and that bit of code right there.</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Andrea: Yes, of course (&#8230;)</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Dan&amp;amp;Don: So, we are about of running out of time here. So, we again want to thank you for coming on &#8211; Her website there &#8211; if you guys are interested to check it out- there is a lot of cool stuff on it and will later post it to the group. So, go check that out. Andrea, do you have anything in closing that you would like to say?</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Andrea: Yes, to parents out there, I just want to mention, I did a lot of work on traumabasedmindcontrol.com, the most important information is in the forensics chapters and if you are in the situation, try to find immediately a lawyer, and go together with the lawyer to a hospital, maybe you pay even privately for it, and do a MRT/CT/nuclear medical examination of your child, document everything, even the reaction of the child toward the hospital equipment and the atmosphere, because most often it is accompanied by flashbacks. If you don´t do this, you have no proof in your hands and most often your child is taken away. And you have any questions, you can reach me on Facebook or over the website traumabasedmindcontrol.com</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Dan&amp;amp;Don: Awesome. Thanks for coming on and we hope to speak to you soon &#8211; it´s been a great discussion.</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Andrea: Thank you for having me and I wish you a nice evening in Virginia then.</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Dan&amp;amp;Don: You too. Thanks for coming on and thanks just the level of bravery it takes to come forward on this (&#8230;) and this is the kind of courage and get this rich and nefarious elites that are manipulating humanity from the shadows (&#8230;) this is where it starts.</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Andrea: Yes, thank you too, for your work, I think we all are brave here, doing something, we all chose our topic, I chose mine your chose yours. Thank you for having me.</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Dan&amp;amp;Don: No problem, talk to you soon.</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Andrea: Bye!</p>

In January 2019, a picture of him was sent to her, showing him with no teeth, meaning the boy lost all his adult teeth, due to torture, not even 10 years old. This besides other injuries already brought to court in 2011, like the destruction of his inner genitals (castration), needles in his tooth root canal, coccyx, brain stem, etc. besides his massive DID/MPD (deliberately caused multiple personality disorder). Instead of helping – at least the boy – Austrian government was eager to strategically entangle thousands via joining the ritualistic torture of the boy as well via hiding the crime by any means.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;<br />

Konrad Kubiczek, Viennese family judge in the Sadegh case </span></strong></span><span style="font-family: 'Libre Franklin',sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"><strong><span lang="EN-US">concerning the horrific flashbacks of Luki Dara Sadegh, then 2 ½ years old, </span></strong></span><span style="font-family: 'Libre Franklin',sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"><strong><span lang="EN-US">despite of having scientific literature on SRA mind control on his desk</span></strong></span></p>
<p align="right"><span style="font-family: 'Libre Franklin',sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">Satanic holidays have been mentioned in scientific literature on satanic ritual abuse or trauma based mind control [1] on one hand because of the confessions of victims, and on the other hand because of the registered crimes (abductions, rapes, mutilations of children) around these “festive” dates, meaning ritual abuse (physical, psychological and spiritual abuse).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">Satanists are obsessed with rituals, symbols, numerology, and so these festive days overlap with the dates of all religions, which is one of the most important satanic/psychopathic characteristics, besides infiltration and silence, betrayal and deception. While holding solid, “respectable” jobs and attending their – official – churches, they celebrate their own “festive days” right afterwards.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">The holidays, as well as the &#8220;language&#8221; of the respective calendars, is &#8220;old&#8221; and again underlines the centuries-old tradition of celebrating these festivals, together with bestial child sacrifices. The perpetrators, one remembers XAVAS and several other artists, do not usually dress up in devil’s </span>horns,<span style="font-size: 13px;"> but are &#8220;in suit and robe&#8221; – that is, in highly respectable, bourgeois professions. These calendars also show how obsessed many Satanists appear to be with &#8220;sexuality&#8221;, preferably S / M &#8211; BDSM [2], as well as with body fluids (blood, semen, urine), as described in detail in the scientific literature on ritual abuse or artistically processed by artists such as Kim Noble, herself a </span>trauma based<span style="font-size: 13px;"> mind control and ritual abuse victim. In his novel &#8220;eleven minutes&#8221;, the life-story of the Brazilian prostitute Maria, famous writer Paolo Coelho also outlines not only BDSM, but also reveals details of &#8220;holy prostitution / sacrifice&#8221;: power &#8211; powerlessness, sadomasochism (submission, subjugation), tormenting and killing &#8220;those unworthy of life&#8221;, especially &#8220;guilt-transference rituals&#8221;, as secret initiation rituals seem to be the main attraction for these groups. Due to the bestial crimes against children, in particular, one can imagine how many perpetrators want to break out of this vicious circle, as documented in the literature, but cannot, since they are caught on photos and video recordings and are therefore in the hands of the Satanists / psychopaths, and thus tend to conduct these festive days &#8220;in a spiritual manner&#8221; and try to seduce others to join.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Libre Franklin',sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">Subsequently, one can observe the machismo of these networks, in which again only the proven stereotypes of femininity are allowed (witch-whore-saints), the feminine element is to be destroyed or suppressed, and also the obsession of Satanists / psychopaths with &#8220;interbreeding&#8221;, so that inter-generational &#8220;dynasties&#8221; are sometimes built in secret, in which women are used only as &#8220;breeders&#8221;, and due to potentially hidden cases of paternity, more people are in turn blackmailable. Due to the &#8220;changing of children&#8221; often mentioned in scientific literature, and reported by all former Illuminati and Illuminati-related persons &#8211; especially Fritz Springmeier, John Todd or Svali &#8211; intergenerational breeding can be better understood: bonds of flesh and blood are thus subordinated to the &#8220;satanic&#8221; goals. The experience of heartbreak, if it remains unreflected upon and unhealed, makes it easier to dehumanize others, and therefore to torture or torment also small children and babies. Again, this brings to mind the words of English specialists in this field: &#8220;No one wants to know that it’s happening next door&#8221;, because that means it isn’t a crime perpetrated &#8220;somewhere&#8221; upon &#8220;poor orphans&#8221; in a &#8220;distant continent&#8221; by &#8220;primitive natives&#8221;, but right in our immediate neighborhood in our western world. The bestial atrocities that people can carry out against other people, especially to children, simply take one’s breath away: American psychologist Colin A. Ross also states in his book &#8220;Satanic Ritual Abuse&#8221; that this ritual abuse is the most horrific thing that can happen to a child, as the damage is irreversible, and also explains why these atrocities must be concealed and denied at all costs: victims must be &#8220;disposed of&#8221;, as well as witnesses &#8211; &#8220;death to traitors&#8221; is the top priority of such groups. Psychologist Ellen Lacter describes on her website http://endritualabuse.org/about/overview-of-the-differences-between-satanism-and-witchcraft/ the different types of abuse conducted by satanists a well as witches (satanism vs. witchcraft): I have not yet been able to find any (specialist) literature on how, above all, these oaths, vows, pledges and promises of guilt can be resolved; this knowledge seems to have disappeared. In my opinion, this knowledge of how to revoke this ritual transfer of guilt, vows and oaths is &#8220;the holy grail&#8221; in the field of &#8220;ritual abuse&#8221;, since satanists / psychopaths are evidently able to change karmic / spiritual laws through rituals, i.e. to offload their own burden onto others. Interestingly enough, most of the people who deal with the topic, from the high-level Illuminati to the hobby esotericist, are convinced that one must have earned his / her &#8220;karma&#8221; by choosing it for themselves in this lifetime: these arguments can be found on Satanic NWO-pages (argued by high-ranking Illuminati), and is also propagated in esoteric circles as well as in teaching institutions for coaching, training and counselling, and subsequently I was told quite often – even by perpetrators in the Sadegh case – that the crime against my son and also myself was therefore justified. Besides offering the chance to comfortably blame someone else, this also enables another goal to be achieved – namely, to obtain the &#8220;moral&#8221; legitimacy to dehumanize the victims (even more). Nevertheless:No one has the right or permission to torture (small) children. No child in the world, no matter what their colour, their nationality or belief system, deserves this suffering. No child in the world should be allowed to be used sexually, spiritually, mentally or physically. Every single child must be protected from such crimes.<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><strong><em>“Now I’m going to tell you a little story. I heard it myself long ago, an old lady told it to me, and I’ve never forgotten it. If I remember rightly, this is how it went:</em></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><strong><em>“I was young at the time when almost all children were often hit. People thought it was necessary to hit them, to make them well-behaved and obedient. All mothers and fathers were supposed to hit their children as soon as they did anything that mothers and fathers thought children shouldn’t do. My little boy, John, was a well-behaved, happy little chap and I didn’t want to hit him. Bu one day, the neighbour came to see me and said that John had been in her strawberry patch and had stolen some strawberries, and that if he did not get a beating he would certainly remain a thief for his whole life. Now, mothers tend to get very frightened and worried when someone comes and complains about their children. And I thought: maybe she’s right, now I really have to give John a beating.</em></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><strong><em>John sat there and played with his building blocks – he was only five years old at the time – when I came in and said that he was going to get a beating and he should go out to cut a switch from a tree himself. John cried as he went. I sat in the kitchen and waited. It took a long time until he came, and he was still crying as he crept in at the door. But he didn’t have a switch with him. </em></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><strong><em>“Mama,” he sobbed, “I couldn’t find a stick, but here is a stone that you can throw!” He handed me a stone, the biggest that he could hold in his hand. Then I began to cry as well, because I suddenly understood what he had thought: “My mummy wants to hurt me and she can do it even better with a stone.” I felt ashamed. And I took him in my arms, and we both cried till we could cry no more, and I thought to myself that I would never, never hit my child. And so that I would never forget it, I took the stone and laid it on a kitchen shelf, where I could see it every day. It lay there a long time, until John grew up. He never became a thief. I would have liked to tell my neighbour, but she had moved away.” </em></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><strong><em>Yes, that is what the old lady said, who told me this when I was still very young. And I still remember thinking to myself: I won’t hit my children either, if I ever have any. I had two children and I never hit them. Despite this, they became good people. And they don’t hit their children either. </em></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><strong><em>Why am I telling you all this? After all, we were supposed to be talking about peace. And how can there be peace in the world if there are no peace-loving people? I think it would be good if a stone lay on the kitchen shelves just about everywhere in the world, as a reminder.” </em></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><strong><em>(Astrid Lindgren: On Peace)</em></strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">This foreword written by Astrid Lindgren describes the reaction of a healthy child and a normal healthy mother. If you have the task of questioning a young child who is showing signs of torture based on the findings of medical MRT/CT/nuclear medical examinations (cf. Istanbul Protocol <a href="http://traumabasedmindcontrol.com/index.php/istanbul-protokoll-fuer-kleinkinder-bei-folterverdacht/?lang=en">http://traumabasedmindcontrol.com/index.php/istanbul-protokoll-fuer-kleinkinder-bei-folterverdacht/?lang=en</a>/), then you are getting into territory that is not only dark but also deeply pathological and sick.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><strong>A criminal phenomenon</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">Signs of torture on the body of your child may indicate that your child is potentially a victim of satanic ritual abuse, also called SRA, or is a “training subject” of trauma-based mind control (MK). SRA can be understood as the combined application of physical, psychological and spiritual assaults. MK is mainly used in the military, intelligence and political areas, although the boundary line between these two forms of abuse is relatively fluid. MK contains an abundance of elaborately devised, complex psychological strategies, ultimately designed to achieve absolute control over the thoughts and feelings of your child. Finally, i.e. at the end of the state-run MK programme, the aim is for your child to be conditioned to such an extent that he/she can be ordered to carry out actions that go against his/her human nature, when “wearing” different fragmented personalities (or “alters”) that are artificially created through torture, ideally without being able to remember carrying out those actions. The means employed to achieve that final state are physical, sexual, psychological and emotional torture. The ability and declared willingness of the perpetrators to subject their child to these kinds of mistreatment and abuse, when ordered to do so by the state, is what distinguishes this group of people from all other living beings on our planet. State-organised torturers are not interested in publicising their criminal actions, which go completely unpunished. MK torture perpetrated on a young child is not the result of a superstitious belief in witchcraft: it is consciously and deliberately planned, organised and continuously perfected. There is basically no part of your child’s body for which a “suitable” torture method does not exist. There is no element (water, air, fire and earth), no ideology and no tool that cannot be used for torturing your child. Clear your mind of the propagandistic falsehoods propagated by western (criminal) cartel media that the torture of young children is only practiced in designated “rogue states”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">These crimes are of course kept secret. This is why it is ultimately very hard to find a definition that covers the “programming” of your child. Survivors describe it as an act designed to activate physical and psychological reactions to external stimuli. A person conditioned in this way is intended to finally be able to react in an intended way after receiving an auditory, visual or tactile signal (trigger), ideally without noticing anything about it themselves. If the conditioning brought about through torture is successful, the political system or network will have raised the perfect mental slave who carries out orders, without conscience and against all the standards of successful ethical coexistence. As the violence-induced raising of such a multiple personality ultimately involves the most serious violations imaginable of the child’s legal rights, in this area of crime the scientific overlaps between psychology, medicine, social sciences, philosophy, criminology and criminalistics are relatively fluid.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">This final construction of a multiple personality outlined above is closely linked to the use of hypnosis. In the respective procedural modules, the programmers used, who are usually conventionally trained physicians, generate a torture-induced, selective intensification of perception in the child victim, whose attention in this respect is ratcheted up through the assaults. Due to the strained attentiveness thus induced, the child’s real state of awareness is clouded. In systematic collaboration, the psychopathic perpetrators described above open a way into the child’s mind by controlling his/her perceptions and memory, and by creating false memories. At the end of several years’ programming, the subject is able to obey like an automaton, receives all instructions uncritically and without question, and can carry out complex orders requiring a high intelligence, but is usually not aware of it all. In order to prevent people who are, from humanitarian motives, on the side of the tortured child from glimpsing the perfidious structures of the state-run torture programmes, false memories are implanted in the child victim and posthypnotic reaction patterns are instilled in order to produce false statements. This is why you should not be surprised if, when asked about the complex sequence of abuse, your child either maintains a consistent silence or behaves in a completely irrational way. The network of perpetrators is fully aware that, due to the ethnic heterogeneity of the police force, at least some police employees would not be indifferent to these severe violations of victims’ legal rights. Even though fully initiated perpetrators within the police ultimately cover up this abuse and actively work to prevent convictions, to begin with the „Police“ organisation is simply too big for the group of perpetrators to control. One cannot therefore rule out the possibility that, when you initially report the offence to the police, you may get a criminal investigator who takes the concerns of the protecting parent seriously. The more importance this officer accords to the parent’s report, the more quickly they will implement urgent measures to search for and secure clues and to determine the evidence. During this important phase, the ring of perpetrators is not yet able to attain ultimate control of the course of the proceedings. Therefore the perpetrators’ strategy must be to implant the suggestion in the police investigator’s mind, through conditioning the child, that the child or the protecting parent is suffering from mental illness. Where fathers are the protecting parent, a suspicion is usually fabricated that the father is the perpetrator. However, SRA or MK can only be carried out by groups of perpetrators, i.e. by several people, as a single individual could never manage to do it. Usually, these protecting parents are quickly separated from the children concerned – without securing evidence of any kind – in order to remove further traces and to falsify the overall impression, and the young child continues to be used without hindrance – usually lifelong.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">The following serve as torture methods before the programme units (quoted from Ellen Lacter, 2017):</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;"><em>Rape: vaginal, anal rape, group rape, using sharp objects, weapons, etc. </em></span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;"><em>Filming the torture</em></span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;"><em>Verbal cruelty, mockery, making child ridiculous, laughing and enthusiasm as reactions to the pain and terror of the victim </em></span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;"><em>Hanging the victim up, including with the head hanging downwards, in stress positions, during which they are tortured by spinning, etc.</em></span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;"><em>Being fully immersed in water tanks filled with ice </em></span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;"><em>Being buried alive with insects, snakes, rats, etc. with an oxygen source that is controlled by the perpetrators</em></span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;"><em>Being hung up above fire or extreme heat </em></span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;"><em>Extreme thirst and hunger</em></span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;"><em>Leaving the victim in urine, excrement and vomit </em></span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;"><em>Being forced to ingest poisonous substances<br />
Control of the victim’s surroundings – painfully hot or cold, dark or intensely bright, being</em></span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;"><em>bombarded with loud noise, etc.</em></span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;"><em>Mutilation, e.g. removing nails or fingers </em></span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;"><em>Removal of body organs and dismemberment of victims kept in complete captivity (Ellen Lacter, 2017) </em></span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">All the information that the victim receives during these torture sessions (“programming”) is stored in his/her deeper psychobiological levels. Therefore, pay close attention to such statements when questioning the child. One special feature of this crime, not just from the aspect of children’s statement psychology, is that it will be suggested to the child that the adults are able to access his/her body at any time and/or to control the individual environment – and this often corresponds to the unimaginable truth:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">Besides the known monitoring technologies in the child’s household, persons are also placed in the child’s immediate vicinity in order to develop a professed emotional relationship with him/her. As soon as this has been firmly established and the child can be successfully deceived into trusting that person, the child is then betrayed. The subsequent messages are clear and unambiguous: “We know everything about you”, “You have betrayed us”, “You won’t escape us”. Other “game versions” involve the child’s being told that an all-hearing microphone has been implanted in his/her tooth, or even a bomb in the stomach, which can explode in the event of betrayal. Adult victims have in fact been able to ascertain the presence of real, i.e. (in)active, implants through conventional medical examinations. Nowadays there is in fact the possibility of ensuring that dementia sufferers or animals can be found by means of (electromagnetic) pulse-controlled implants. An additional – though still less researched – aspect is the assumption that parts of MK programming as well as the use of triggers can meanwhile be carried out via microwaves and radiofrequencies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">As the silence of the young child involved is so important in terms of criminal law, the techniques to ensure it are practically innumerable: threats that their beloved primary caregiver (usually the mother) will be killed; needles in the area of the gums as a “training in keeping silent”; and wiping conscious memories through deliberately caused concussion, electroshock treatment and psychoactive medication. An additional way of ensuring silence is the showing of the pretended or actual liquidation of a “traitor”. Above all, witnessing a real murder makes a particularly devastating impression on the child. Killings in the context of so-called “snuff pornography” (filmed torture, followed by the death of the victim) are also used for this purpose. It is likewise known that it is suggested to the young children that they have killed a person or else – far more dramatic for the child’s psyche – they have actually been forced to kill someone. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">It is thus very easy to understand that you can only achieve a comprehensive account of all these circumstances with endless patience and absolute, benevolent neutrality. The child must deal with his/her shame about the fact that it has been the victim of a series of the most unimaginable acts of emotional, mental and physical violence and has thus displayed accompanying physical reactions and emotions, that no one has helped and that he/she was even laughed at by the group of perpetrators. These things have formed part of the child’s everyday experience. It is therefore your task to remain completely neutral during the questioning process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">Never forget the punishment with which the child has been threatened if he/she speaks out, which usually involves the murder of the primary caregiver or torture. The process of questioning the child must basically be done in several stages, and must therefore be planned to take place over a period of several months. <strong>As the investigators are generally left to their own resources when working out the course of the abuse as a whole, they must organise the questioning sessions themselves. If investigators know people with knowledge of criminology knowledge in their personal or professional circle (police detectives, juvenile court representatives, lawyers specialising in criminal law), these can of course be consulted and/or brought in too. </strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">The person concerned must be clear in their mind about what they may ultimately be getting into. Regarding doing it oneself: even a poorly planned questioning session is better than leaving the child alone with the abuse.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">Although MK/SRA as a criminal phenomenon has, for obvious reasons, not been made a specific subject of study in criminological research up to now, its individual torture methods have been. Sexual violence perpetrated on a child in a private context has meanwhile been relatively well studied. Because the sexual abuse is a cornerstone in the process of programming the child, one can therefore use it as a starting point. It is of course important to have an idea of the basic process of questioning a child victim before you start. Nevertheless, the essential difference here is that a child who has been through SRA/MK has undergone unimaginable torture with the aim of splitting their personality. The essential elements of this crime are therefore briefly described below:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><strong>Phenomenon of the split personality</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">The simplest form of split personality consists of a normal state (A) and the hypnotically controlled state (B).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">Below: Visible change of personality in a child who is secretly enrolled a torture programme.</span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-317" src="http://traumabasedmindcontrol.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/KeinFoto_Luki_PersonalitySplit_Ende.png" alt="" width="949" height="558" /></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><em>Source: “Luki” Dara Sadegh on a supervised visit to his mother Mag. Andrea Sadegh 2013: Change of personality within 10 seconds. Assumed posthypnotic command: “Whenever you’re near your mother, remember what you’ve done and said: if she knew, she wouldn’t love you anymore.”</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">The change of the child’s personality is based on a posthypnotic command or a trigger. To do this, planning, a trigger and implementation are needed. An effectively instilled posthypnotic command is not aimed just at generating the outward behaviour of the subject – it also has to create inner mental states in the controlled human tool. Using inculcated key stimuli or codes, it is possible to condition complex operative sequences. The programmer can thereby also command the victim to forget the key signal again as soon as they have carried out the ordered action. This method is intended to undermine the police investigation of the crime outlined above. An additional obfuscation strategy is what is called “posthypnotic amnesia”. Here, the contents of the child’s memory are fragmented through mentally traumatising the child. This perfidious tactic is deemed successful if an outsider does not notice that the victim’s memory is impaired. To achieve this, during the child’s programming the method of fear-based suggestion is used. One technique is to plant the idea that they have a headache when they are inwardly processing the abuse suffered that day. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">Below: A child mentally processing the abuse suffered that day – a headache induced by suggestion, also called a “splitting headache”. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><em>Source: “Luki” Dara Sadegh, taken by his mother Mag. Andrea Sadegh, in the summer of 2011, when the child had suffered the first flashbacks.</em> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">An observable headache can also be the result of an artificially induced neurosis, consisting of inculcated guilt or inferiority complexes intended to prevent the child from talking about their experiences.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><strong>Why is it done at such a young age?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">Due to their highly imaginative minds, children can be more easily influenced than adults. In order to prevent prosecution, perpetrators exploit the fact that due to their still limited vocabulary, the child does not feel able to talk about the abusive assaults. Through the MK programming techniques a number of separate identities, called “alters”, are generated in the child. The group of perpetrators that installs, activates and controls these alters can ultimately also communicate with the respective individual alters. So that the child is outwardly able to cope with their everyday life, in addition to the alters, an “apparently normal personality” (ANP) must also be in place. The ANP is, so to speak, the facade for the programmed individual’s future role in the social system. The ANP, functioning as an outer shell, ensures that the multiple personalities finally remain hidden to non-initiates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">If investigators try to get the child to open up by showing him/her affection, a word of warning: perpetrators will deliberately create associations between natural interpersonal actions (kissing, caressing) or words (“love”, pet names, etc.) and dark threats against the child. You must therefore reckon with triggers deliberately implanted in the child to ensure that they are mentally imprisoned by an “inner guard” and their constant fear of the consequences of being a “traitor” i.e. of speaking the truth. The same applies to conditioning and hypnosis in connection with the initial routine procedures in a criminal investigation. In the presence of someone urgently suspected of being involved in the abuse, the child may for example in greet that person with joyful eagerness, while simultaneously rejecting their actual persons of trust, usually the protecting parent. Since enormous financial resources are available for the programming process, props, magic tricks, stage plays, special effects, film screenings, cameras and microphones are also used. The manipulation of the child’s thoughts is activated by means of roleplay and characters from fairy-tales or other adventure worlds (extra-terrestrials, demons). These are stored in the child’s mind linked to certain colours: i.e., during the programme unit concerned, the perpetrators show themselves to the child in identical costumes and colours. Thus, in time, it is possible to forge cross-connections in the mind of the child victim, which are accessible to the programmer through codes. For you, as an outsider, these are usually completely innocuous, everyday words or other triggers. Nevertheless, the child is prepared in such a way that, in the end, the “opening and closing” of the child’s personalities function appropriately. This process is considered successful if the trigger words have a certain rhythm and the treacherous word combination or other trigger chains are selected in such a way that an everyday situation cannot trigger a change of personality.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">Multiple personality disorder (MPD), also called “dissociative identity disorder” (DID) is used in the international system for classifying illnesses (ICD 10), in this case concerning the psychiatric illnesses (DSM4). It would thus be a punishable offence for the perpetrator to deliberately create a sick person twice over (knowing the prohibition on simultaneous intention to perpetrate a crime and succeeding in perpetrating that crime). Consequently, there is a causal connection between dysfunctional family integration, the use of violence, mental trauma and disorders when processing experiences. It is thereby necessary for the child to be placed in the hands of the programmers at regular interviews. The above-described mental trauma of the child is devised based on a process of “internally running away”. Since the physically much weaker child is unable to justifiably defend itself against the assaults and can also see no way of physically escaping from the location of the abuse, it must finally choose the path of mental dissociation. The rule of thumb here is: <em>“The earlier the traumatisation of the child occurs, the greater the probability of multiple personality disorder.” </em>A decisive point is thereby the extent of control over the child’s defence mechanisms. In the specialist literature, one finds different instructions as to the most suitable time for this. After dissociation and violent training, children aged two and a half can already display a completely split personality. Under the supervision of a physician, tortures such as pinching fingers with pincers, violent blows to the head, rapes, and having fingers painfully trapped in a mousetrap while being locked in a room, etc. As soon as the child stops crying and is only whimpering in pain, it is released. Then the child receives their aversion conditioning through commands. Not all stages are the same here. Meanwhile, the following main programming procedures are known:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><strong><em>Alpha: Basic programme – the aims are the unresisting obedience and automatic reflexes of the child</em></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><strong><em>Beta: Sexual programme activated by a key word</em></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><strong><em>Delta: Assassin programme, fighter programme</em></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><strong><em>Theta: Programme for integration in occult groups</em></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><strong><em>Omega: Obscuration programme with the aim of maintaining the split psyche of the child </em></strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">A typical technical method for creating multiple personalities is “spin programming”, “spinning” or the German term <em>Rädern</em> which (appropriately enough) means “being broken on the wheel”. The child is strapped to a rotating disc, and through extremely painful centrifugal forces, their personalities are polyfragmented</span><span style="font-size: 13px;">. This kind of programming method already begins in earliest childhood. The child can either be spun on their own axis – as on a spit – or turned in a vertical direction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">Here too, one must of course take the rapid development of new technical possibilities into account. Seizure-inducing treatments, CT, as well as the influencing of the mind by means of electromagnetic fields are used here, and are still relatively little researched in relation to young children. The special feature is basically that the programming of the child relates to the generating of personality fragments. Therefore, a specific message is always conveyed to the child during programming. While being questioned, the child may thus give you answers that appear completely incoherent. The same applies if you thereby observe illogical ways of behaving. However, when you become more familiar with them, these are always connected to commands instilled through violence:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;">You deserve to be punished – we’ll find you wherever you are</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;">No one believes what you say</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;">You deserve the violence you have experienced</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;">We’re watching you and can kill your parents</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;">The police will come to get you – you’ll go to prison</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">Subsequently building on this, in the next stage the victim is usually indoctrinated with the following ideas (cf. Ellen Lacter, 2017):</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;"><em>You are evil.</em></span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;"><em>You are a murderer.</em></span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;"><em>You are an accomplice in crimes (often such scenes are filmed as evidence).</em></span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;"><em>You are now one of us.</em></span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;"><em>You are now a voluntary member of the network which commits rapes and abuse.</em></span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;"><em>No one except us will ever want to have anything to do with you again.</em></span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;"><em>The people who have been taking care of you can’t take care of you ever again.</em></span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;"><em>No psychotherapist will ever want to help you.</em></span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;"><em>The whole of the clergy will condemn you.</em></span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;"><em>You are lost in the sight of God.</em></span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;"><em>You now belong to: _____ (a god/goddess that demands blood sacrifices).</em></span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">Certainly, the most ruthless method is brain surgery. Here, the surgeon deliberately damages the healthy tissue of the healthy child. Another possibility is medically influencing the amygdala (the part of the brain important for emotions and feelings) using electrical current. Other surgical interventions (scars on the brain stem, etc.), and the removal and mutilation of glands, are also known methods.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">The child often remembers the torture in everyday life in flashbacks, usually triggered by associations while processing the experience. It can thereby quite possibly happen that the child reveals the abuse at this very moment: the young child experiences the torture as if it is happening again. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><strong>First of all, some good news: as soon as they have been able to relate one of the events in their entirety, the young child finds greater peace of mind: in every flashback or anxiety state, and in every recounting of the abuse, you are already helping the children to heal their unimaginable experiences to a great extent. </strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">Finding out about the torturers’ world represents a particular challenge for you, but is everyday routine for the children, as is the often-staged, seemingly “fairytale-like” world of Satanism: Satanic rituals and the procedures conducted in an MK programme can definitely overlap. According to Michaela Huber (1995), victims have reported the following methods:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;"><strong><em>Strange smells</em></strong><em> […]</em></span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;"><em>Men in black coats/cloaks, hoods, <strong>masks</strong>, etc.;</em></span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;"><em>Cellars, painted black or their walls hung with black cloths;</em></span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;"><em>[…]</em></span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;"><em>Rituals with oil, <strong>blood </strong>[…]</em></span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;"><strong><em>Blood, that runs down one’s naked body </em></strong><em>[…]</em></span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;"><em>Eating raw animal or human flesh, or <strong>faeces</strong>, drinking urine and blood</em></span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;"><em>[…]</em></span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;"><strong><em>Vaginal, oral, anal gang rape; being penetrated with sticks</em></strong><em>, knives, crucifixes, etc.</em></span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;"><strong><em>Blows, kicks, electric shocks</em></strong></span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;"><strong><em>Being locked in chests</em></strong><em>, coffins, water-tanks, etc.;</em></span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;"><em>[…]</em></span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;"><em>Loud, sacral or Wagnerian <strong>music</strong>, “sacral” chanting […]</em></span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;"><strong><em>Extreme feelings of shame and guilt, the feeling of having to “sacrifice” oneself</em></strong><em> or of “being chosen to die”, to feel like “Satan” (or having “inner alters” who think they are Satan)</em></span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;"><em>A <strong>vow that cannot be broken</strong>, otherwise someone will die (either they themselves or someone close to them, or their favourite animal)</em></span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;"><strong><em>The exaction of punishments upon them and/or other children or adults </em></strong><em>who have been “disobedient” </em></span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;"><strong><em>Invocations and curses</em></strong><em>; the feeling of being able to be killed by the words of a spell, etc. </em></span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">Before starting a questioning session, you should therefore bear in mind the following patterns of reaction, which the child has already able to show an investigator or protecting parent on occasion in the past: </span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;">Fear of giving blood samples, and of dental examinations</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;">Fear of being tied up</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;">Ritualistic chanting</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;">Nervousness at meals (cocoa: faeces; red fruit-juice: blood; barbecues in summer: burns/scalding)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;">Wanton destruction of toy figures and dolls (mutilations)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;">Fear of “harmless” everyday objects</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;">etc.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><strong>The questioning session</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">Questioning young children is an essential skill in cases of suspicion of torture: it is made very clear to children through a wide variety of tortures, extreme drills and threats that they should never, ever talk about what has happened and never name names. The perpetrator networks are very aware of that particular danger and have usually infiltrated city-centre facilities such as child help centres, and medical, psychiatric and therapeutic services, to prevent possible further examinations of the child, and to usually forcibly remove the child from its protective primary care-giver (usually the mother, but in some cases also the father). If, after already having invested in a particular child, the torture of the child becomes visible due to injuries or flashbacks, the loss of the child to the perpetrator networks not only involves the risk that parts of the recognised and named network will be severely prosecuted under criminal law, but also means a massive financial loss. As the perpetrators of these networks have as a rule themselves gone through these kinds of torture-based programmes as young children, it is easy to verify this in the case of adults too, by means of radiological technologies like MRT/CT/nuclear medical examinations, based on unmistakeable characteristics (incapacity to empathise, dissociative tendencies, scars on the brain stem, etc.).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><strong>Triggers during questioning </strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">Before asking questions, you need to be aware that touch triggers may have been implanted in the child: you should therefore be careful with touching and only touch the child with his/her permission. The most well-known here is the silence touch: for this painful lesson, the child is first encouraged to chatter. The child is then given an electric shock, or pricked in the gums or in the tongue. Another method is to use a silence trigger that is activated through stroking the child. It should thus be no surprise if, after being caressed or receiving any affection, immediately clams up towards the other person. Further triggers, which perpetrator networks often like using are pressure (stress, strict voice, accusing look, hand signs). Take care to ensure that your body language is congruent and explain to the child if anything irritates you. Openness, truth and – most importantly – the absolute benevolent neutrality of the investigator are the only way to attain reliable results.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">Later on, two cameras will be needed: one camera should point at the child and the other at the questioner. Ideally, there should be a third camera filming you both from above (bird’s eye view). There is footage from the sadly notorious Hampstead case in which the police investigator, who offers behavioural</span><span style="font-size: 13px;"> training on a private basis, triggers the children during the “questioning session” using hand signs, see below:</span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2305" src="http://traumabasedmindcontrol.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/hamp2fürbefragung.png" alt="" width="853" height="478" /></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">Source and summary: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSOa6Siko-8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSOa6Siko-8</a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">It is therefore essential that you remain neutral, no matter what you may hear or experience during the questioning session. Give the child as much space and freedom as possible during the interview: any pressure can put the child into states of fear and anxiety, and thus cause them to clam up or to feed you “well-rehearsed stories”.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><strong>Video recordings</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">As a general rule, every questioning session should be recorded on video: it is important to ensure that the physical reactions are also recorded – both those of the investigator and the child. The same applies if a question causes the child to suffer a flashback. For the purpose of giving evidence, it is therefore important to find out and record whether and how the flashback corresponds to the question posed. Take time to think about what you have heard. Don’t rule out any hypothesis and don’t be afraid of not being able to calm the child after a flashback: the only unforgivable mistake you can make is to abandon the child to the perpetrator network. If the questioning session is filmed, both the continuation of the session after the child has “calmed down” and a fully documented flashback have value as evidence. Bear in mind that all the recorded injuries (Istanbul Protocol) should be addressed and investigated in the interview.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><strong>A short digression: Personal evidence and material evidence</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">The evidentiary value of the child’s statement can vary; here is an overview:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">A: Personal evidence</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">Personal evidence can come from the statement of a court-appointed expert, an accused party/defendant or a witness (your child).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">B: Material evidence</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">Material evidence can consist of a document or what is called a “piece of visual evidence”. The document is a physical declaration of ideas and intentions (e.g. a written document). The piece of visual evidence contains no ideas, but may enable certain conclusions to be drawn (e.g. if the investigator finds an object used to commit the offense based on the child’s statement).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">The reason that the material evidence is so important is because, detached from the series of criminal actions, it speaks for itself and enables non-involved people to draw conclusions about the course of the abuse and the perpetrators involved. The material evidence is thus basically objective and is therefore given preference over personal evidence in court. Although it is true that it can be checked using scientific methods, it can however yield a false trail to probative facts due to mistakes in securing evidence, in examinations, storage and analysis. Personal evidence is basically subjectively influenced. You should therefore try to check the truth of the child’s statements and to diligently follow up any indications given by the child as to potential material evidence. Questioning the child should make it easier for you to, for example:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;">identify suspects</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;">determine that perpetrators belong to a group</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;">reconstruct the assaults</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;">seek/secure evidence</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><strong>Legal information</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">If you subject the child to questioning, this is a private investigative procedure, not an official interrogation/hearing. In an official interrogation/hearing, the questioner is there in an official capacity, states the fact and makes a formal request for information required by the authorities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">As already explained, you should video all questioning sessions with the child from two, and ideally from three angles. After each questioning session you should transcribe the entire contents. You should ensure that in every questioning session you have at least one witness of good repute and good standing. Make suitable backup copies of every video recording and written record. [!] In addition, depending whether the laws in the country concerned permit it, the witness should consider making use of the possibility of affirmation in lieu of an oath. The video recording should document the complete conversation and also portray all the non-verbal reactions of the child – including you yourself. The questioning process itself should not be interrupted. Place the child in such a way that they can definitely be clearly seen in the video. The arms, hands and feet must also be fully visible. Take the necessary lighting conditions into account and switch off your mobile phone. Avoid being disturbed by third parties (put a “Don’t disturb” on the door). Make sure that the child has had enough sleep and has had a proper meal beforehand. If several children have potentially been abused, they should be questioned separately from one another.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><strong>Checklist &amp; procedure</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">Don’t simply ask questions in an unmethodical way: instead, draw up a checklist beforehand. In cases of sexual assault, no individual questioning session should last longer than 30 minutes; any breaks should be documented. When questioning in cases of SRA or MK, follow your intuition, and also let the question last longer. You need to be aware that you are certainly not going to be able to clear up such a complex cluster of actions in a short time. Also, be aware that if perpetrator networks continue to assault the child, the child can be prepared relatively easily for 30-45 minutes, i.e. deliberately prepared.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">All the important facts should then be worked through point by point. The checklist should contain the essential points, such as:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;">What is already known about the assaults, times of the abuse and perpetrators?</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;">Driving routes to the scene of the abuse, means of transporting the child, instruments used in the abuse?</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;">What patterns of injury have been ascertained in the visual examination of the child (Istanbul Protocol)?</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">Besides the specific characteristics of the case of a child in an MK programme, there are also basic features which apply to all child victims. Children are often taciturn and use short sentences. When putting the questions, you should therefore also take into account the child’s style of talking and linguistic deficiencies – which are often due to the complex trauma suffered. The statements display lack of vocabulary, and often lacks analogies and metaphors due to its lack of life experience. It is therefore possible that, in the course of assimilating the experience and in accordance with their mental capacity, the child describes an offense by referring to a familiar process (“he wetted” for ejaculation). If you ask the child intimate questions, explain in advance why it is necessary. The child still has a play world, which is not compatible with adult logic, while conversely adult logic can hardly grasp the experiences of the child. A child’s speech comprehension first starts to slowly develop after about 24 months. The child thereby believes that all actions and processes are purposeful (“The weather will be nice if I eat all the food on my plate”). <strong>Small children are unable to intentionally lie, as they lack the necessary cognitive preconditions to do this.</strong> If the child is not able to give you information on the chronology of events, objects, descriptions of people and distances, this is not a lie. It also does not yet have any pubescent self-interest, such as the desire for revenge or craving for recognition. <strong>Remember that the group of perpetrators likewise use a “fantasy vocabulary”, especially with young children – ask questions to clarify any expressions that are not clear to you.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">It may of course also happen that, during a questioning session, a child from an MK programme will give you the false answers that have been instilled in them through violence, or from time to time reveals inauthentic reaction patterns. Nevertheless, because of their age, the child cannot consistently maintain this “myth”. Always bear in mind the child’s conditioned conflicts of loyalty and fear of punishment. The child may therefore refuse questions or give evasive answers. Make use of the child’s impulse to play. The use of children’s picture books and story cubes can likewise be very helpful in questioning sessions, particularly with children who are already “keeping quiet”.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><em>Source: Andrea Sadegh – “Story Cubes from © Gigamic” (2017)</em></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><strong>Beyond the imaginable</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">Even if a child describes an injury that you failed to see in the prior visual examination (compare the Istanbul Protocol http://traumabasedmindcontrol.com/index.php/istanbul-protokoll-fuer-kleinkinder-bei-folterverdacht/?lang=en), you have no reason to doubt the truth of that information. Bear in mind that you must react by exploring new directions in accordance with a statement from the child (looking for the crime scene, searching for clues and evidence). Always remember that you can still find clues that you have overlooked in your immediate surroundings. Also, bear in mind that there are no limits to the evil imagination of the torturers. Thus, in the Sadegh case, the two-and-a-half-year-old child suffered massive flashbacks on seeing a toilet brush. In time, it emerged that the child had not been hit with it but had been anally penetrated with the handle. You should therefore never interrupt the flow of the child’s narrative: if need be, after documenting the questioning session, bring in an expert who specialises in SRA or MK, and also text researchers can be extremely helpful in putting the parts of the story into the right order, especially in the case of young children.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><strong>Forensic analysis of traces: a brief summary</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">Traces/clues are material objects and physical changes at the macro and micro levels. These arise through the series of actions perpetrated and can make it possible to reach conclusions about the perpetrators and their modus operandi. If there is no connection between a material change and the incident relevant to the crime, we speak of a false trail. However, when dealing with MK, you must reckon with changes that have been deliberately brought about. What one is dealing with in such a case is a fake clue, rather than a false trail. Clues that are significant with regard to child torture can be:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">Evidence of a crime: That is, traces produced due to the criminal activities at the scene of the crime, and found either on the child themselves or on the perpetrator. Such traces can make it easier for you to reconstruct the course of the abuse. Some examples of this are, for example, defensive injuries on the child, or traces of secretions and blood connected to the abuse described by the child.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">Traces of perpetrators: These are traces that the perpetrator has left on the instruments of abuse, on the child or at the scene of the crime (sperm, blood, vaginal secretions, hairs, textile </span>fibres<span style="font-size: 13px;">).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">Traces are created interactively. You have to start from the assumption that the perpetrators will also find these traces.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><strong><em>Traces of blood: </em></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">“Blood is a special juice.” This statement has a special meaning in criminalistics. The special aspect is that the characteristics of human blood are preserved and are passed on genetically in accordance with the laws of nature, and that blood is serologically detectable and classifiable. After leaving the body, blood is at risk of being destroyed from bacteria, moulds and environmental influences. The analysability of a blood spot therefore gets more and more limited as time goes on. Blood rapidly changes colour and is therefore difficult to see. Nevertheless, even in the case of minute amounts, it is possible to prove in a laboratory that a substance found is in fact blood. Human blood has unalterable characteristics.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">One such characteristic is the statistical classification in accordance with blood groups. The so-called ABO system is used for this purpose.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">A: 44%</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">B: 11%</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">AB: 5%</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">O: 40%</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">A blood spot can thus be used to narrow the investigation down to a particular suspect as against other people with different blood groups. After the child makes a statement, it is therefore important to secure the specific instrument used for the abuse or their clothing. As, according to this elimination system, you are holding a means to single out a potential suspect from other persons, the blood spot enables considerably more, based on the DNA evidence. The DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) contains the genetic information of the suspect. This particularly applies if you discover blood or sperm on the child’s body immediately after an assault. The probability of the chromosomal pattern of the DNA of two people being the same is less than 1 to 30 billion. For this reason, if several traces of a suspect’s DNA are found, the chances of being wrong basically become immeasurably small. It is now also possible to identify the DNA from hair roots and vaginal secretions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">A laboratory analysis can differentiate between the gender and origin of the blood (blood from the nose or anus). As in MK Ultra torture sessions, dogs can also be deployed as an instrument to abuse the children, a blood spot could also stem from a dog. It is likewise possible to differentiate between human and animal blood in a laboratory (using the so-called “Uhlenhaut method”). In addition to securing the trace carrier, while keeping it as sterile and germ-free as possible, you should first take a photograph of the trace (close-up, giving scale of length).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">As the torture of the child encompasses the aspects of humiliation and degradation, you must also expect to possibly find traces of urine. The presence of urine is verified through the concentration of urea in the trace. However, larger quantities are needed for an examination. Verification is done on a microscopic and biochemical basis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">Sexual torture can result in traces of the saliva of a suspect being found. Here, verification is carried out through the enzyme ptyalin produced in the body. Following an assault, despite subsequently washing the child, saliva can nonetheless remain clinging</span><span style="font-size: 13px;"> to the child’s mucosal cells.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">In actuality, there is no limit to the circumstances under which the hairs and flakes of skin of a suspect can remain or be transferred. Even if you thoroughly wash the child after the torture. Through microscopic examinations and biological comparisons, it is possible to distinguish human hairs from hair-like wool fibres and synthetic fibres. By way of qualification, it must be said that it is generally not possible to definitely allocate hairs to a perpetrator. However, it is a different matter if the found hair combines special attributes such as, for example, pathological changes through fungal infestation or residues of care products. However, it is possible to determine whether it fell out naturally or was torn out violently by magnifying the detachment point of a hair. This would be significant in cases where children are dragged along the floor by the hair or when the hair on the head is pulled violently.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">Besides human traces, there is also the possibility of finding textile fibres. This includes plant fibres (cotton), animal fibres (wool), mineral fibres (glass fibres) and chemical fibres (nylon). The transfer of fibres in fact takes place everywhere every day. Above all, textile fibres are characterised by great durability. Such fibres are extremely tenacious and can hardly ever be completely removed. Studies (e.g. Aldermasten/GBR) </span><span style="font-size: 13px;">show that about 80% of all fibres transferred from other people are lost within 48 hours. The rest continue to stick tenaciously. After every questioning session, you should therefore compare the child’s statements and check whether any corresponding trace carriers can be found and/or which people the child names to you as suspects.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><strong>Questioning intervals and techniques </strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">Even if you question the child at intervals, you should not interrupt the video recording &#8211; otherwise the perpetrators would easily be able to say that you may have manipulated the child. Bear in mind that due to the torture suffered, the child was limited in its cognitive ability, was probably dissociated or that his/her personality may already be split. Unlike normal perception, the human brain stores traumatic events in an unordered memory fragment. You therefore have to constantly adjust your discoveries about the course of the abuse, depending on the situation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">You need to help the child understand that they are not being forced to take part in the questioning. It should be clear that they should only report what they have actually experienced.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">Example:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><em>“Now, before you tell me anything, you can just quietly think about what you would like to say. It is important that you tell me the truth. But it’s okay if you can’t say something. You can simply tell me that you don’t know.” </em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">Show the child that you are extremely interested in them and help them to sharpen their capacity for remembering places, people and</span><span style="font-size: 13px;"> activities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">Examples:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><em>“Have you ever been to the Christmas market? –Oh, you were there last year.” </em></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">This helps to strengthen the child’s perceptions regarding a particular place.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><em>“Were any other people with you at the Christmas market?”</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><em>“Aha, so you were at the Christmas market with Granny.”</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><em>“What does your Granny look like? – Aha, so Granny has glasses and short hair.”</em> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">This helps the child to focus their attention on a person more sharply.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><em>“What did you do together at the Christmas market? – Wow cool, so you sat in a fire engine! But Granny didn’t? No, she’s already much too old. You’re right! Wouldn’t it be funny if grannies always came with the fire brigade? – Do you know all about what the fire brigade does? And did you even have candyfloss? So when do you always get candyfloss or other sweets?”</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">This helps to increase the child’s attention regarding activities. At this point, you should already focus on building a positive relationship with the child. Describing familiar surroundings, people and activities like this </span>helps<span style="font-size: 13px;"> the child to feel more secure for the subsequent questioning about the scene of the abuse, the suspects and the abuse itself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">You can now begin to ask about the abuse. Try to get the child to describe the scene of the abuse, the abuse itself and the suspects as precisely as possible. Take time for this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">You should never pre-formulate answers for the child; never make any assumptions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><em>“So then X lay down on you and painfully forced his penis into your anus?”</em> – A young child would never make such a statement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">You should also ask what the child means when it is describing the abuse and the respective body parts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">Examples:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><em>“What do you mean when you say ‘his wee-wee’?”</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><em>“What do you mean when you say ‘he did a banana in my botty’?”</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><em>“What do you mean when you say ‘wet and hit’?”</em></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">Make sure that you do not give the child any information that it has not already disclosed. Nevertheless, you should stick to the initial subject in your questions. Avoid conditioning the child and always be sparing with praise, maintaining a benevolently neutral but appreciative attitude.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">It is up to you how you create a good relationship with the child. Here are some examples </span>for<span style="font-size: 13px;"> how to build a relationship: </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><em>“What kind of children’s films do you watch on TV?”</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><em> “What’s your favourite toy?”</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><em> “Are you already going to Kindergarten?”</em></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">Then you can slowly get round to talking about the abuse.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><em>“Can you tell me why you have such bad dreams?”</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">Avoid posing suggestive questions, even if you already have some idea of the basic underlying situation. The child should be permitted to formulate statements by themselves and independently.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">Examples:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><strong>Neutral questions:</strong> Such questions are free of implied suspicion: the child is not being fed any answers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><em>What? Where? How? How often? Who?</em></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><strong>Contrary questions:</strong> Although such questions have a suggestive drift, in the </span>end<span style="font-size: 13px;"> you can hardly be accused of having influenced the child.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><em>“Did Mrs K say that you are allowed to tell your Mummy all about it?”</em> (When you sense a command to keep silent)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><em>“But how could X touch you there – after all, you had your trousers on, didn’t you?” </em>(When you assume that the child had to take its clothes off.)</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"> <strong>Multiple-choice questions</strong>: These enable you to narrow down the facts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><em>“Were you standing, sitting or lying down?”</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><em>“Was it on the bed or on the sofa?”</em></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><strong>Leading questions</strong> (these are suggestive and should be avoided):</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><em>“So then X strangled you with the belt round your neck in the car?”</em></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">Use additional phrases to underpin important statements. Or use a <strong>counter-probe</strong> through counter-suggestion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><em>“I didn’t quite understand that bit. Can you explain it to me a little more exactly?” </em></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">If you reach a point where the child can betray their emotions, there is a <strong>risk of an emotional outburst or a flashback</strong>. At this point, you have two possible solutions to this. As you are recording the questioning session on video, the filmed flashback does of course have appropriate value as evidence. Or you can immediately distract the child and behave as if you haven’t noticed their state of agitation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">One possibility: The child is just about to burst into tears. You react as follows:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><em>“There was something I absolutely wanted to ask you. You did tell me that you like playing with your Indian castle. Have you got some little Indians to play with? – Really? Lots and lots? You must show them to me some time!”</em></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">Pose the questions in such a way that you always have as complete a picture as possible of every single assault. Do not move on to the next incident of abuse until you have completely finished questioning the child about a course of events. You should thereby bear in mind that the child needs to be given the space and freedom to open up and talk about it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">Something else you should observe is also the way that the child may show the abuse in actions. This is certainly due to their inability to express the abuse in words</span>,<span style="font-size: 13px;"> but also corresponds to the way that children relive experiences. <strong>So it may also happen that instead of making a statement, the small witness displays a physical position, a series of movements or accompanying mimicry.</strong> Make use of this childlike characteristic.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">Example:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><em>“Could you show me how X hit you?”</em></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">With questions as to the guilt of a suspect, the child can get into difficulties. A statement like “It was him” is not sufficient here. The child must be able to describe characteristics specific to the person. You should therefore try to get as accurate as possible a description of the person. The same applies to the times and durations of the abuse. You have to help the child here. As you proceed, you can show the child photos of different people, including suspected perpetrators.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">Remember that being able to “recognise” perpetrators again has become essential for the survival of the young children: as a rule, these children recognise every detail of the torturers again and can also – depending on their age – describe them. In the Sadegh case, when looking through private photographs, the two-and-a-half-year-old child immediately recognised a former acquaintance of the mother and cried: <em>“Kind! Kind!”</em> and was pleasantly surprised to see that person again in a photo on her laptop. In answer to the question “<em>Hey – that’s great! What kind thing did A do that makes you so excited, darling?” </em>– <em>“She told Farrokh to stop. Stop. When it was ouchy.” </em>– No doubt, Ms. A had been present at (at least) one torture ritual and had intervened. Although such complex procedures as these can be faked to deceive a young child, one cannot suggest such a series of events to a child of this age through programming.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><strong>Created/programmed confusion</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">When the child makes the simplest statements such as <em>“my Mummy/my Daddy”</em> or <em>“my Granny/my Grandpa”,</em> check who the child is talking about: on the one hand, the children are indoctrinated through torture who their “Mummy”, “Daddy”, etc. is, while on the other hand strangers can simply call themselves “Granny” or “Grandpa”. Here is an actual example of how young children can be forced to call other people “Daddy” or “Mummy” through torture:</span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2308" src="http://traumabasedmindcontrol.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/fatherhood_folter.png" alt="" width="851" height="444" /></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">Source: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0A1Kb30IN0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0A1Kb30IN0</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">When they are having flashbacks, in which they are remembering the torture and reliving it all 1:1, the screaming of young children sounds similar to, and sometimes even more heartrending than that heard in the above video.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><strong>There are no limits to the mind games, just as there are no limits to the torture methods or the triggers. Statements about location</strong> are also deliberately trained under torture:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">Example:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><em> “Where were you?” “At home with Daddy.” </em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">– Here, in this context, you should ask whether the child means the familiar “Daddy” or whether they may be referring to some other “Daddy”, and also check the details of the location – “<em>What did it look like there?</em>” It is known from the Sadegh case that “<em>At home with Daddy”</em> sometimes also meant being tortured and raped by a series of other paedocriminals</span><span style="font-size: 13px;"> in strange apartments. Over a period of just under 9 months, it emerged that there had been a number of Daddies and quite a few Mummies too. “At home with Daddy” could mean in the child’s father’s apartment, but could also mean being forced into child prostitution in council flats, and in an attic which was obviously in the centre of Vienna, near the Vienna “Naschmarkt”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">Other mind games with names are also known to be played in cults: programmers sometimes take the name of deities (in the Sadegh case, one of the main programmers told the young child that he was called “<em>Oka</em>”), while Dr</span><span style="font-size: 13px;"> White, Dr</span><span style="font-size: 13px;"> Green, etc. are familiar names from the American programming scene.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><strong>A reminder</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><strong>Remember that the child has survived the torture, is sitting in front of you and, being very young, can relatively quickly attain healing or huge relief, provided that they are protected from the perpetrator networks and not separated from the protecting parent. Due to their experiences, the young child has already lived through more trauma than you will probably ever experience, no matter how long you live</strong>. <strong>Therefore, bear in mind that you can’t do anything</strong> <strong>“wrong” as long as you act with benevolent, appreciative neutrality and openness, unless you abandon the child to its own resources and thus to the perpetrator networks, who not infrequently stem from the immediate family circle. </strong></span></p>
